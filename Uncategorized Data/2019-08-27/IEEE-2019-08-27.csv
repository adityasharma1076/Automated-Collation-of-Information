IEEE,Blue Ocean Robotics Acquires Beam Telepresence Robot From Suitable Technologies,Robotics,2019-08-27,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/blue-ocean-robotics-acquires-suitable-technologies-beam-telepresence-robot,"      Today, Blue Ocean Robotics, a Danish robotics company, is announcing the acquisition of Suitable Technologies’ Beam telepresence robot business. Blue Ocean has been a Beam partner for five years, but now they’re taking things over completely. The Beam robot began its life as an internal project within Willow Garage. It was spun out in 2012 as Suitable Technologies, which produced a couple different versions of the Beam. As telepresence platforms go, Beam is on the powerful and expensive side, designed primarily for commercial and enterprise customers.  The most recent news from Suitable was the introduction of the BeamPro 2, which was announced over a year ago at CES 2018. The Suitable Tech website still lists it as “coming soon,” and our guess is that it’s now up to Blue Ocean to decide whether to go forward with this new version. Blue Ocean calls itself a “robot venture factory.” I’m not entirely sure what a “robot venture factory” is but Blue Ocean describes itself thusly: The company is known for developing professional service robots from the problem, idea and design phase to the development, commercialization and scaling phase. Every robot is placed in its own subsidiary which is responsible for scaling sales, customer service, support and everything else oriented towards global markets and customers. The parent company handles all development and production of robots across the organization.  Ah, that explains it! Blue Ocean does already have a couple portfolio companies making very specific robots, including a UV disinfection robot for hospitals and a sort of mobile patient lift also for hospitals. They’re working on some kind of agriculture robot, too. I’d love to be able to tell you more, but the press release doesn’t offer much: With the acquisition, Blue Ocean Robotics sees an opportunity to generate additional synergy: “Our development of robots is based on our own in-house created toolbox with reusable technology components. This means that we can build all of our robots fast, inexpensively, and better than others,” says Blue Ocean Robotics’ CTO John Erland Østergaard. “Some of our robots, for example the UVD disinfection robot, are already equipped with remote controls. With the Beam technology being a big seller in the healthcare sector, we can continue to grow our business within this industry by having our distributors present both UVD and Beam when they visit customers.” The press release is very specific that Blue Ocean isn’t acquiring Suitable Technologies itself—they’re acquiring the “assets and rights associated with the robot Beam” from Suitable, which I guess means that Suitable is still around somehow. But it’s really not clear what Suitable is without Beam, which (as far as we can make out) is the entirety of what the company does. Anyway, we’re glad that there’s enough interest in high-end telepresence robots to support this acquisition, and we hope that Blue Ocean will be investing in BeamPro 2 and further generations of the robot. It’s come a long way from the original Texai robot from Willow Garage, and still has a lot of potential. For more information, visit the new Beam website that Blue Ocean has just launched.

IEEE,All of the Winners in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Tunnel Circuit,Robotics,2019-08-27,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/all-of-the-winners-in-the-darpa-subterranean-challenge-tunnel-circuit,"      The first competitive event in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge concluded last week—hopefully you were able to follow along on the livestream, on Twitter, or with some of the articles that we’ve posted about the event. We’ll have plenty more to say about how things went for the SubT teams, but while they take a bit of a (well earned) rest, we can take a look at the winning teams as well as who won DARPA’s special superlative awards for the competition.  With their rugged, reliable robots featuring giant wheels and the ability to drop communications nodes, Team Explorer was in the lead from day 1, scoring in double digits on every single run.  Team CoSTAR had one of the more diverse lineups of robots, and they switched up which robots they decided to send into the mine as they learned more about the course.   While many teams came to SubT with DARPA funding, Team CTU-CRAS was self-funded, making them eligible for a special $200,000 Tunnel Circuit prize.   DARPA also awarded a bunch of “superlative awards” after SubT: To score a point, teams had to submit the location of an artifact that was correct to within 5 meters of the artifact itself. However, DARPA was tracking the artifact locations with much higher precision—for example, the “zero” point on the backpack artifact was the center of the label on the front, which DARPA tracked to the millimeter. Team Explorer managed to return the location of a backpack with an error of just 0.18 m, which is kind of amazing. With just an hour to find as many artifacts as possible, teams had to find the right balance between sending robots off to explore and bringing them back into communication range to download artifact locations. Team CSIRO Data61 cut their last point pretty close, sliding their final point in with a mere 22 seconds to spare.  Team Robotika had some of the quirkiest and most recognizable robots, which DARPA recognized with the “Most Distinctive” award. Robotika told us that part of the reason for that distinctiveness was practical—having a robot that was effectively in two parts meant that they could disassemble it so that it would fit in the baggage compartment of an airplane, very important for a team based in the Czech Republic. Kevin Knoedler, who won NASA’s Space Robotics Challenge entirely by himself, brought his own personal swarm of drones to SubT. With a ratio of seven robots to one human, Kevin was almost certainly the hardest working single human at the challenge. The Fan Favorite award went to the team that was most popular on Twitter (with the #SubTChallenge hashtag), and it may or may not be the case that I personally tweeted enough about Team NCTU’s blimp to win them this award. It’s also true that whenever we asked anyone on other teams what their favorite robot was (besides their own, of course), the blimp was overwhelmingly popular. So either way, the award is well deserved.  DARPA shared this little behind the scenes clip of the blimp in action (sort of), showing what happened to the poor thing when the mine ventilation system was turned on between runs and DARPA staff had to chase it down and rescue it: The thing to keep in mind about the results of the Tunnel Circuit is that unlike past DARPA robotics challenges (like the DRC), they don’t necessarily indicate how things are going to go for the Urban or Cave circuits because of how different things are going to be. Explorer did a great job with a team of rugged wheeled vehicles, which turned out to be ideal for navigating through mines, but they’re likely going to need to change things up substantially for the rest of the challenges, where the terrain will be much more complex. DARPA hasn’t provided any details on the location of the Urban Circuit yet; all we know is that it’ll be sometime in February of 2020. This gives teams just six months to take all the lessons that they learned from the Tunnel Circuit and update their hardware, software, and strategies. What were those lessons, and what do teams plan to do differently next year? Check back next week, and we’ll tell you.

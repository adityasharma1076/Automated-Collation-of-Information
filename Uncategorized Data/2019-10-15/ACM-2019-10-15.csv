ACM,Gymnastics' Latest Twist? AI Judges That See Everything,ACM,2019-10-10,-,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/sports/olympics/gymnastics-robot-judges.html,"       Gymnastics' Latest Twist? AI Judges That See Everything     The New York TimesAndrew KehOctober 10, 2019   The gymnastics world championships in Germany, the biggest gymnastics meet outside the Olympics, for the first time used an artificial intelligence (AI) system to evaluate athletes' performance by measuring and analyzing skeletal positions, speed, and angles via three-dimensional laser sensors. International Gymnastics Federation president Morinari Watanabe envisions such robot judges eliminating human error and subjectivity from gymnastics contests; “this is a step toward the challenge of justice through technology,” Watanabe said. At the world championships, the AI system was a means for human judges to confirm scores when gymnasts either formally contested their score, or the score widely deviated between judges. International Gymnastics Federation sports director Steve Butcher said all athlete information collected at the competition would be discarded at a predetermined expiration date, to address privacy concerns.               *May Require Paid Registration  "
ACM,Biologically Inspired Artificial Skin Improves Sensory Ability of Robots,ACM,2019-10-10,-,https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/35732-1/,"       Biologically Inspired Artificial Skin Improves Sensory Ability of Robots     Technical University of Munich (Germany)October 10, 2019   Researchers at the Technical University of Munich in Germany have designed a system integrating artificial skin with control algorithms, which they used to create the first autonomous humanoid robot with full-body synthetic skin. The skin is composed of hexagonal cells about an inch in diameter, each with a microprocessor and sensors to measure pressure, acceleration, proximity, and temperature. The researchers use an event-based system to track the cells instead of continuous monitoring, with individual cells only sending data when values change; this cuts the processing load by up to 90%. Said the university’s Gordon Cheng, “Our system is designed to work trouble-free and quickly with all kinds of robots. Now we're working to create smaller skin cells with the potential to be produced in larger numbers.”                 "

ACM,Doctors Look to Eye-Tracking to Improve Care,ACM,2019-10-10,-,https://www.wsj.com/articles/doctors-look-to-eye-tracking-to-improve-care-11570716001,"       Doctors Look to Eye-Tracking to Improve Care     The Wall Street JournalDavid M. EwaltOctober 10, 2019   Eye-tracking technology is increasingly being used by healthcare professionals for a variety of purposes, including teaching medical students, improving surgeries, and diagnosing eye-related issues such as nearsightedness. Companies like Sweden’s Tobii are selling technology that allows other companies to add eye-tracking capabilities to their own products. For example, a system made by Tobii client ControlRad employs eye-tracking hardware to direct x-ray scanners, lowering radiation dosage for patients and doctors during surgery. Israeli company NovaSight's vision-assessment system has patients wear liquid-crystal display eyewear to diagnose visual impairments. Gartner’s Werner Goertz anticipates more eye-tracking products will hit the market next year, as availability grows of low-cost hardware and safe, reliable technology.               *May Require Paid Registration  "
ACM,Researchers Use Game Theory to Identify Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance,ACM,2019-10-09,-,https://news.wsu.edu/2019/10/09/researchers-use-game-theory-successfully-identify-bacterial-antibiotic-resistance/,"       Researchers Use Game Theory to Identify Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance     WSU InsiderTina HildingOctober 9, 2019   Washington State University (WSU) researchers have developed a new technique that taps machine learning and game theory to identify previously unknown antibiotic-resistance genes in bacteria. The team used a machine learning algorithm and game theory to examine interactions of several features of genetic material, including structure and physiochemical, evolutionary, and compositional characteristics of protein sequences. The application was able to detect antibiotic-resistant genes in three different types of bacteria with 93% to 99% accuracy. Said WSU Professor Shira Broschat, “This novel game theory approach is especially powerful because features are chosen on the basis of how well they work together as a whole to identify likely antimicrobial-resistance genes — taking into account both the relevance and interdependency of features.""

ACM,Drones as Detectives: Surveying Crime Scenes for Evidence,ACM,2019-10-08,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/drones/drones-as-detectives-surveying-crime-scenes-for-evidence,"       Drones as Detectives: Surveying Crime Scenes for Evidence     IEEE SpectrumMichelle HampsonOctober 8, 2019   Researchers at the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil are designing drones to perform forensic examinations at crime scenes by recording evidence from multiple angles. The AirCSI drone first sweeps the scene, scanning the environs with a stereo camera, as a visual self-localization and mapping system tracks the drone's position. A secondary system with another camera captures images from multiple angles. The drone then plots a zigzag path, making additional sweeps to gather finer information on each piece of evidence. Tests with simulation software found that using multiple angles to detect evidence is up to 18% more effective than using a single angle.                 "
ACM,Engineers Solve 50-Year-Old Puzzle in Signal Processing,ACM,2019-10-10,-,https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2019/10/10/signalprocessing,"       Engineers Solve 50-Year-Old Puzzle in Signal Processing     Iowa State University News ServiceOctober 10, 2019   Iowa State University researchers have solved the mystery of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm, which along with the FFT algorithm comprise the core of signal processing. Iowa State's Alexander Stoytchev and Vladimir Sukhoy developed the inverse chirp z-transform (ICZT) algorithm to generalize the IFFT algorithm, as the FFT was generalized into the CZT. The ICZT plots the output of the CZT back to its input, matching the computational complexity or speed of its counterpart so it can be employed with exponentially decaying or growing frequency elements. Sukhoy said the inverse algorithm was a harder challenge than the original forward algorithm, and ""we needed better precision and more powerful computers to attack it."" Sukhoy added that visualizing the algorithm within the mathematical framework of structured matrices was critical.                 "
ACM,Algorithm Helps Autonomous Vehicles Avoid Pedestrians,ACM,2019-10-10,-,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/algorithm-av-safety-pedestrians/,"       Algorithm Helps Autonomous Vehicles Avoid Pedestrians     The Engineer (UK)October 10, 2019   Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada have developed a decision-making and motion-planning algorithm to help autonomous vehicles (AVs) minimize injuries and damage when accidents with pedestrians are unavoidable. When such a collision is anticipated, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm evaluates all available actions, selecting the one with the least serious consequences. Waterloo's Amir Khajepour added that the system is a necessity, disputing the notion that AVs can avoid all collisions. The MPC algorithm determines the most appropriate AV response in emergency situations, in accordance with pre-defined mathematical calculations accounting for injury severity and damage.

Stanford,How uncertainty in scientific predictions can help and harm credibility,Social Sciences,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/14/uncertainty-scientific-predictions-can-help-harm-credibility/,"   The more specific climate scientists are about the uncertainties of global warming, the more the American public trusts their predictions, according to new research by Stanford scholars.  A new study examines how Americans respond to scientists’ predictions about climate change. (Image credit: Getty Images)  But scientists may want to tread carefully when talking about their predictions, the researchers say, because that trust falters when scientists acknowledge that other unknown factors could come into play. In a new study publishing Oct. 14 in Nature Climate Change, researchers examined how Americans respond to climate scientists’ predictions about sea level rise. They found that when climate scientists include best-case and worst-case case scenarios in their statements, the American public is more trusting and accepting of their statements. But those messages may backfire when scientists also acknowledge they do not know exactly how climate change will unfold. “Scientists who acknowledge that their predictions of the future cannot be exactly precise and instead acknowledge a likely range of possible futures may bolster their credibility and increase acceptance of their findings by non-experts,” said Jon Krosnick, a Stanford professor of communication and of political science and a co-author on the paper. “But these gains may be nullified when scientists acknowledge that no matter how confidently they can make predictions about some specific change in the future, the full extent of the consequences of those predictions cannot be quantified.” Effects of communicating uncertainty Predicting the future always comes with uncertainty, and climate scientists routinely recognize limitations in their predictions, note the researchers. “In the context of global warming specifically, scientific uncertainty has been of great interest, in part because of concerted efforts by so-called ‘merchants of doubt’ to minimize public concern about the issue by explicitly labeling the science as ‘uncertain,’” said Lauren Howe, who was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford when she conducted the research with Krosnick and is first author on the paper. “We thought that, especially in this critical context, it was important to understand whether expressing uncertainty would undermine persuasion, or whether the general public might instead recognize that the study of the future has to involve uncertainty and trust predictions where that uncertainty is openly acknowledged more than those where it is minimized,” Howe said. To better understand how the public reacts to scientists’ messages about the uncertainties of climate change, the researchers presented a nationally representative sample of 1,174 American adults with a scientific statement about anticipated sea level rise. Respondents were randomly assigned to read either a prediction of the most likely amount of future sea level rise; a prediction plus a worst-case scenario; or a robust prediction with worst-case and best-case scenarios, for example: “Scientists believe that, during the next 100 years, global warming will cause the surface of the oceans around the world to rise about 4 feet. However, sea level could rise as little as 1 foot, or it could rise by as much as 7 feet.” The researchers found that when predictions included a best-case and worst-case scenario, it increased the number of participants who reported high trust in scientists by 7.9 percentage points compared with participants who only read a most likely estimate of sea level rise. Changes in environmental policies, human activities, new technologies and natural disasters make it difficult for climate scientists to quantify the long-term impact of a specific change – which scientists often acknowledge in their predictions, the researchers said. They wanted to know if providing such well-intended, additional context and acknowledging complete uncertainty would help or hurt public confidence in scientific findings. To find out, the researchers asked half of their respondents to read a second statement acknowledging that the full extent of likely future damage of sea level rise cannot be measured because of other forces, such as storm surge: “Storm surge could make the impacts of sea level rise worse in unpredictable ways.” The researchers found that this statement eliminated the persuasive power of the scientists’ messages. When scientists acknowledged that storm surge makes the impact of sea level rise unpredictable, it decreased the number of participants who reported high trust in scientists by 4.9 percentage points compared with the participants who only read a most likely estimate of sea level rise. The findings held true regardless of education levels and political party affiliation. Not all expressions of uncertainty are equal, Howe said: “Scientists may want to carefully weigh which forms of uncertainty they discuss with the public. For example, scientists could highlight uncertainty that has predictable bounds without overwhelming the public with the discussion of factors involving uncertainty that can’t be quantified.”  Howe earned her doctorate in social psychology in 2017 from Stanford University, where she was the Shaper Family Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow. Howe is now a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Zurich. Other co-authors on the paper include Bo MacInnis, an adjunct lecturer in the Department of Communication at Stanford.

Stanford,Young children have intuitions of great teachers,Social Sciences,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/14/young-children-intuitions-great-teachers/,"   Human are incredible learners, in part because they are also accomplished teachers. Even at a very early age, people are adept at instructing others. But while there has been a lot of research into how people teach, there has been much less research on how they decide what to teach in the first place – a critical piece of the educational puzzle.  From an early age, children can make decisions about what kinds of information to teach. (Image credit: Getty Images)  Now, new research from Stanford scientists reveals that even young children consider what their students will find most useful or rewarding when deciding what to teach. A team led by Hyowon Gweon, assistant professor of psychology, showed that 5- to 7-year-olds decide to teach things that will not only be rewarding but also challenging for their students to learn on their own, maximizing what the student gets out of the interaction. “People have to be choosy about what they teach, because it is impossible to teach everything; our results suggest that even young children are able to reason about the expected reward and the cost of learning from the learner’s perspective to determine what is best to teach,” Gweon said. The study, published Oct. 14 in Nature Human Behavior, shows that even young children know what is useful to the learner. To find out how children think about what to teach, the researchers had children explore two toys on their own before deciding which toy to teach someone else to use. The toys differed in how interesting they were to play, how hard they were to learn, or both. Prior to the experiment, Gweon’s team had worked out that toys consisting of an orb that emitted different light colors were generally more interesting to kids than toys that played music. They also knew that toys became harder to learn depending on the number of buttons and the combination involved in making the toy work. Using this information, the team developed a computational model that predicts what children might choose if they understood how to maximize the learner’s benefit. After having children explore the pair of toys, the experimenter told children that a friend would need help learning to play with the toys later. The experimenter then asked children which toy they wanted to teach someone to use. Across six different conditions, the researchers found that children’s decisions about which toy to teach minimized the difficulty of learning while maximizing the fun of the toy, consistent with the computational model. “Children prioritized to teach both the harder toy and the cooler toy,” said doctoral student Sophie Bridgers, lead author of the study. “This shows that children not only think about what is fun for others to learn, but also what is challenging.” Julian Jara-Ettinger, assistant professor of psychology at Yale University, was also a co-author on the study. Two of the older participants actually chose the opposite of what the researchers found more generally; they wanted the learner to explore the harder toy, rather than teaching the learner how to use it. When the experimenters asked them why they made this decision, the children said they wanted to give the learner the chance to figure out a challenging problem. In other words, they knew that discovering something costly could be rewarding, “which is an intuition that great teachers have, but exactly when we perceive the cost of learning as a negative or a positive is something we cannot fully explain yet,” Gweon said. The development of such intuitions very early on might explain why humans have always been incredible learners, able to adapt to their environment. “The content of what is helpful to teach others has changed over time, but the key factors that determine what is helpful are the same,” Gweon said. “If I can only teach you one thing, I want it to be something useful; that is, something that brings you reward and saves you from trouble.”  Gweon is also a member of the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.

Stanford,An artificial retina that could help restore sight to the blind,Science & Technology,2019-10-15,-,https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/artificial-retina-could-help-restore-sight-blind,"  For more than a decade, researchers have been working to create artificial digital retinas that can be implanted in the eye to allow the blind to see again. Many challenges stand in the way, but researchers at Stanford University may have found the key to solving one of the most vexing: heat. The artificial retina requires a very small computer chip with many metal electrodes poking out. The electrodes first record the activity of the neurons around them to create a map of cell types. This information is then used to transmit visual data from a camera to the brain. Unfortunately, the eye produces so much data during recording that the electronics get too darn hot. “The chips required to build a high-quality artificial retina would essentially fry the human tissue they are trying to interface with,” says E.J. Chichilnisky, a professor in the Neurosurgery and Ophthalmology departments, who is on Stanford’s artificial retina team. Members of the team, including Chichilnisky and his collaborators in Stanford’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments, recently announced they have devised a way to solve that problem by significantly compressing the massive amounts of visual data that all those neurons in the eye create. They discuss their advance in a study published in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems. To convey visual information, neurons in the retina send electrical impulses, known as spikes, to the brain. The problem is that the digital retina needs to record and decode those spikes to understand the properties of the neurons, but that generates a lot of heat in the digitization process, even with only a few hundred electrodes used in today’s prototypes. The first true digital retina will need to have tens of thousands of such electrodes, complicating the issue further. Boris Murmann, a professor of electrical engineering on the retina project, says the team found a way to extract the same level of visual understanding using less data. By better understanding which signal samples matter and which can be ignored, the team was able to reduce the amount of data that has to be processed. It’s a bit like being at a party trying to extract a single coherent conversation amid the din of a crowded room — a few voices matter a lot, but most are noise and can be ignored. Boris Murmann, professor of electrical engineering, member of Stanford Bio-X and of Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. “We compress the data by being more selective, ignoring the noise and baseline samples and digitizing only the unique spikes,” Murmann says. Previously, digitization and compression were done separately, leading to a lot of extra data storage and data transfer. “Our innovation inserts compression techniques into the digitization process,” says team member Subhasish Mitra, a professor of electrical engineering and of computer science. This approach retains the most useful information and is easier to implement in hardware. Dante Muratore, a postdoctoral researcher on the team, says the process is surprisingly straightforward conceptually. Each spike has its own wave-like shape that helps researchers determine what sort of cell produced it — a key bit of knowledge in the retina, where different cells have different functions. Whenever two or more electrodes in the artificial retina record identical signal samples it is treated as a “collision,” effectively wiping out the data. The collisions can be safely ignored. On the other hand, whenever a unique signal sample is recorded by a single electrode, it is considered to have high value and gets stored for further processing. In testing their approach, the researchers say their efficient data-gathering method misses just 5% of cells, yet reduces the acquired data by 40 times. The researchers believe it is a first step to a day of efficient, cool-running implantable chips that would work not just in the eye but in other so-called “neuroprosthetic” brain-machine interfaces that turn nerve impulses into computer signals. Such applications might include brain-controlled machines that restore motion to the paralyzed and hearing to the deaf, or that open new approaches that aid memory, alleviate mental illness or even improve self-driving vehicles. “This is an important step that might someday allow us to build a digital retina with over 10,000 channels,” Muratore says.

Stanford,Science lessons through a different lens,Social Sciences,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/14/science-lessons-different-lens/,"   For years, one of the highest-rated comedy series on television was The Big Bang Theory, a show whose central characters portray “old, tired images of the science community, sending a resounding message about who belongs in science,” says Bryan A. Brown, an associate professor of science education at Stanford Graduate School of Education. “These stereotypes have been reinforced for generations. We can’t ignore the barriers these expectations impose.”  A new book examines obstacles young people of color face in the science classroom, and how teachers can better connect their lessons to students’ cultural identities. (Image credit: Getty Images)  Brown’s research examines why cultural stereotypes and language about science matter, especially for students in multilingual and multicultural communities who might not fit the images they see or relate to the words they hear in popular culture and in the classroom. Brown, a former high school science teacher, has studied science education in urban communities for more than two decades, exploring the relationship between student identity, classroom culture and academic achievement. For the past eight summers, Brown has brought fifth- and sixth-graders from inner-city schools to the Stanford campus for a weeklong science camp, where the students get excited about biology, physics, chemistry and engineering – and learn from teachers of color, who provide critical role models in the field. In his new book, Science in the City, Brown looks at the role that language and culture play in teaching science and technology. We spoke with him about some of the obstacles young people of color face in the science classroom, and how science teachers can better connect their lessons to students’ cultural identities.   You write that students of color have to pay a “black tax” when they enter a science classroom. What do you mean by that? It’s the idea that people of color are judged harshly and have to pay an additional price to belong. When students arrive in science classrooms, they bear the weight of the history, cultural expectations and stereotypes about who can become a scientist.  Bryan A. Brown (Image credit: Courtesy Stanford Graduate School of Education)  Black people have often been told by their elders that in order to succeed, they have to be better than their white counterparts. School culture imposes even more of a tax: Students have to prove their academic competency, negotiate awkward discussions and know what language practices are deemed acceptable. They know that if they don’t speak the way the teacher speaks, they might not be seen as intelligent. There’s an iconic photo from 1962 of James Meredith, the first African American student admitted to the University of Mississippi. He’s walking into the school for the first time, surrounded by U.S. marshals and angry community members who clearly don’t believe he deserves to be there. When I think about the challenges he had to face in that learning environment, there’s no way they were equal to the challenges his classmates faced.   How are students of color at a disadvantage in the science classroom in particular? For one thing, we know that scientific concepts are learned and solidified when students have an opportunity to explain them. The more you talk about something, the more you understand it. But in many schools, especially urban ones, teachers are the ones doing the explaining. If teachers want students to understand a scientific idea thoroughly, they need to give them opportunities to explain it. But academic language is not culturally neutral. Teachers need to broaden their idea of the language of science as something that’s rooted in the realities of the lives of people of color.   Can you give an example? Well, for instance, if you’re teaching the process of osmosis, you might have a kid who knows a lot about cooking – maybe he learned how to marinate carne asada from his grandmother. Marinating food is an example of osmosis. If you soak meat in a mixture of seasonings and water – a solution – then how does the meat end up with seasoning on the inside? But teachers don’t necessarily view that as a scientific act. Talking about something students already know through their culture can give them a vision of the science we experience every day. It’s the same science they’re learning about in the classroom. There is no cultural distance between students of color and a successful science education.   How can teachers make science lessons more culturally meaningful for students while still satisfying national guidelines? My research team has actually been working for some time to help teachers with this. The Next Generation Science Standards introduced an ambitious and innovative new curriculum, but the curriculum doesn’t really emphasize culture – it doesn’t push the idea that science can be culturally relevant for kids in the context of their community. We just launched a resource at scienceinthecity.stanford.edu especially for teachers in urban schools that offers lesson plans that are culturally relevant but also match NGSS expectations. It’s also a place where teachers can connect to share their lessons, get input from other teachers, find a mentor or even become a mentor for someone else. We hope teachers will get involved to make the community even stronger. "
Stanford,Precision physics with ‘tabletop’ experiments,Science & Technology,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/09/25/precision-physics-tabletop-experiments/,"   The history of particle accelerators is one of seemingly constant one-upmanship. Ever since the 1920s, the machines – which spur charged particles to near light speeds before crashing them together – have grown ever larger, more complex and more powerful.    Tabletop physics Physicists at Stanford and SLAC are inventing small, sensitive experiments to explore fundamental questions in physics that have eluded large particle accelerators. This series of stories explores these so-called “tabletop” experiments.  Precision physics with ‘tabletop’ experiments A different kind of gravitational wave detector A radio that searches for dark matter    Consider: When the 2-mile-long linear accelerator at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory opened for business in 1966, it could boost electrons to energies of about 19 gigaelectronvolts. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which finished construction in 2008, can boost protons to more than 700 times higher energy levels and resides in a massive elliptical tunnel wide enough to encircle a small town. Future supercolliders being planned by CERN, China and Japan promise to be even more immense and energetic (and also more expensive). The strategy has paid off handsomely with discoveries that have helped confirm the soundness of the Standard Model, our current best understanding of how nature’s fundamental forces and subatomic matter interact. As successful as particle accelerators have been, however, Stanford theorists Savas Dimopoulos and Peter Graham are betting that scientific treasures await discovery in the other direction as well. For years, the pair have argued that smaller and less expensive, but more sensitive, instruments could help answer stubborn mysteries in physics that have resisted the efforts of even the largest atom smashers – questions like “What is dark matter?” and “Do extra spatial dimensions exist?” “Peter and I and our group have been thinking about this for 15 years,” said Dimopoulos, who is the Hamamoto Family Professor at Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences. “We were sort of lonely but very happy because we were exploring new territory all the time and it was a lot of fun. We felt like eternal graduate students.”  Peter Graham and Savas Dimopoulos are among Stanford physicists working on smaller-scale devices to answer large questions. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)  Scalpel vs. hammer But their ideas have been slowly gaining traction among physicists, and last fall the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded Stanford and SLAC researchers three grants totaling roughly $15 million to use quantum technologies to explore new fundamental physics. Key to these efforts are the kinds of small-scale, “tabletop” experiments (so-called because most of them would fit on a lab bench or in a modest-sized room) that Dimopoulos and Graham have long advocated for. “Everything is smaller, except for the ideas,” Dimopoulos quipped. “These types of experiments could help solve some very important problems in physics.” The instruments Dimopoulos and Graham have in mind exploit the weird properties of quantum mechanics – such as wave-particle duality and the seemingly telepathic link between entangled particles – to detect and measure minute signals and effects that particle accelerators are simply not attuned to. Tabletop experiments are considered high-risk, high-reward projects because they are generally cheaper to build and operate than colliders, said Asimina Arvanitaki, a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute. “If you’re pitching a project that costs several billion dollars, you better have a very good reason for its existence and be reasonably sure you’re going to succeed,” added Arvanitaki, a former Stanford postdoc in Dimopoulos’ lab. “But the cost of tabletop experiments is so low, and the timescales for producing results is so short, that it takes some of that pressure off.” Building on existing technologies The Moore Foundation grants will fund three projects: Two are experimental and will focus on developing new technologies for detecting dark matter and measuring gravitational waves. But the third, worth about $2.5 million and awarded to Dimopoulos and Graham, will be used to further develop the theoretical underpinnings that will enable future experiments. “There’s been a history of particle accelerators discovering new physics and finding new particles, but it’s not clear that that can go on forever, so it’s important to think of other complementary ways to get at these underlying questions about nature,” said Ernie Glover, the Moore Foundation’s science program officer.   “Everything is smaller, except for the ideas. These types of experiments could help solve some very important problems in physics.” —Savas Dimopoulos Professor of Physics   Crucially, the experiments Dimopoulos and Graham are proposing rely on relatively mature, high-precision technologies that, for the most part, were developed with other uses in mind and for other fields, such as medicine and applied physics. “That’s what got us really excited,” Dimopoulos said. “We realized there were all these possibilities out there that particle theorists weren’t really thinking about.” A good example is nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, imaging, which forms the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, a common medical scanning technique. A few years ago, Graham and others theorized that a proposed ultralightweight dark matter candidate called an axion could influence the nuclear spin of normal matter. Dark matter is thought to make up the bulk of the matter in the universe, but it has evaded every attempt so far at characterization. Excited, Graham contacted an atomic physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, named Dmitry Budker to discuss designing a dark matter detector based on this effect – only to discover that the technology already exists. “He said it’s going to work because what we were describing was basically NMR,” said Graham, a theoretical physicist at the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. Graham and Budker teamed up with other physicists to design the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment, or “CASPEr,” which uses NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) to detect axion and axion-like particles. These particles are predicted to have such weak interactions and low masses that they would never show up in a collider, which are better equipped to search for massive dark matter candidates such as WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles).  Former Stanford postdoc Asimina Arvanitaki, now at the Perimeter Institute, has proposed several tabletop experiments to investigate physics beyond the reach of particle colliders. (Image credit: Colin Hunter)  Similarly, another Moore Foundation-funded tabletop experiment called MAGIS-100 relies on atom interferometry technology initially developed in the 1990s as a general-purpose tool for making precise measurements. The project, a collaboration between Stanford’s Mark Kasevich and Jason Hogan and researchers at Fermilab and other universities, could potentially detect ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves around 1 hertz, a frequency range beyond the sensitivity of most existing or even proposed detectors. Current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO are sensitive to the very final moments of the black hole collisions that generate the spacetime ripples, but MAGIS-100 could provide scientists with a much longer viewing window. “LIGO saw just a fraction of a second of the event, but the black holes were twirling around each other and generating gravitational waves for millions or billions of years before that. Those waves were just in lower frequency bands,” Graham said. “By looking at other frequencies, we could observe the black holes for longer and perhaps discover new gravitational wave sources.” Intuition Dimopoulos and Graham plan to use the Moore Foundation-funding to continue devising new schemes for co-opting technologies like NMR and atom interferometry in the service of fundamental physics research. “It’s that connection that’s hard,” Graham said. “The experimental physicists and engineers who develop the technologies aren’t necessarily thinking about what other deep, fundamental questions could be tested, and the theorists are often unaware that tools for testing their ideas already exist.” But Dimopoulos and Graham are now old hands at making such connections. “In principle, you have to know all possible technologies,” Graham said. “In practice, you just have to know the right ones, but it takes a nontrivial intuition to realize something like ‘Oh, wait a minute, it looks like this technique might actually be able to observe extra dimensions or some other new physics.’” In one sense, what Dimopoulos and Graham are advocating for is a return to the way physics was done before colliders came to play such an important role in physics and the division of physicists into primarily theoretical and experimental camps. “Before World War II, physics was just like what we’re doing right now,” Dimopoulos said. “Felix Bloch was both a theorist and an experimentalist, and so was Enrico Fermi. Even Einstein did experiments. There wasn’t a ready group of experimentalists that you could outsource your ideas to. You had to invent the techniques and look around at emerging technologies.” To read all stories about Stanford science, subscribe to the biweekly Stanford Science Digest. "

Stanford,Archaea hold clues to ancient ocean temperatures,Science & Technology,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/07/archaea-hold-clues-ancient-ocean-temperatures/,"   Solving a decades-old mystery, Stanford researchers have discovered proteins that enable hardy microbes called archaea to toughen up their membranes when waters are overly warm. Finding these proteins could help scientists piece together the state of Earth’s climate going back millions of years to when those archaea were cruising the ancient oceans.  A view of the Pacific Ocean from Pescadero, California. Researchers used archaea with a genetic dataset from the north Pacific Ocean to identify proteins that could help gauge ancient ocean temperatures. (Image credit: Patrick Tomasso / Unsplash)  “People have been looking for these proteins for 40 years,” said Paula Welander, an associate professor of Earth system science in Stanford University’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth), and lead author of a study describing the finding published Oct. 7 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. With this finding scientists can more accurately use the lipids – or fats – found in archaeal membranes and preserved in the ocean’s sediments to estimate historic ocean temperatures, Welander said. Battening down the hatches When under stress, archaea fuse their usually double-layered cell membranes into a single layer. Battening down the hatches in this manner firms up the membranes, which, being mostly made of fat, can get too floppy when the temperature spikes – like butter left on a kitchen counter. Some archaea further modify the structures that fuse their membrane layers by adding on ring-like pieces that make the membranes even more compact and sturdy. These adaptations are helpful from a climatology perspective, since the membrane-linking structures – along with those sets of rings – readily preserve in marine sediments. By examining the numbers and kinds of rings, climate scientists can gauge surface water temperatures where and when those archaea lived. This technique has been used as evidence of the warmer seas of the Jurassic era, dating back more than 150 million years to the heyday of the dinosaurs. Finding the proteins involved in making those structures resolves some uncertainties scientists have had about inferring ancient temperatures from archaeal lipids – what they call the paleotemperature proxies. Climatologists have presumed that a single group of archaea, the Thaumarchaeota, are responsible for making lipids with rings found in open oceans and that they add those rings in response to water temperature changes. But if other environmental factors such as salinity and acidity trigger ring production in other marine archaeal groups, that could scramble how they read the temperature signals. According to the new study, climatologists can breathe a sigh of relief. By finally nailing down the proteins in play, the Stanford researchers show that Thaumarchaeota are indeed the dominant source of the ring-bearing membrane structures in ocean waters, supporting previous ideas of ancient sea surface temperatures. “With that critical information now in hand, we can start to constrain some of the uncertainty about this particular archaea-based paleotemperature proxy,” Welander said. Pursuing the proteins Although not identified until the late 1970s, archaea have since been recognized as constituting a whole new third domain of life, alongside the more-familiar bacteria and eukaryotes – multicellular organisms, including humans. Although archaea superficially resemble bacteria, biochemical and reproductive differences testify to their uniqueness. Many archaea are also extremophiles, which thrive in austere environments like hot springs where other life cannot survive. To find the ring-making proteins, the Stanford team experimented with Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, among the least difficult archaea to grow and manipulate in a lab. “This organism is one of the very few archaea that has a genetic system where we can do the kind of work we like to do,” Welander said. Her team set out to find which proteins enabled S. acidocaldarius to attach rings to its membrane-spanning structures. The researchers first found three possible genes by looking across the genomes of archaea that do and don’t construct rings. They then created mutants in the lab lacking one, two or all three genes and, ultimately, two of these genes proved integral to the ring structures. Those genes failed to turn up in another group of archaea that share marine environments with Thaumarchaeota and were considered as a possible, additional source of ringed structures in sediment samples. With that contribution ruled out, the sea temperature estimates derived from the paleotemperature proxy in question look more robust. Taking it global Welander said that scientists can now look into extending the Stanford team’s findings into well-sampled marine regions worldwide. Her team picked through a genetic dataset from the north Pacific Ocean, and it therefore only directly speaks to that particular biome. Other datasets from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, for example, should reveal if Thaumarchaeota are also responsible for laying down the molecular fossils of interest in those areas. These paleotemperature proxies could even be extended into lakes and other environments, Welander said, opening up still more pages in Earth’s climate chronicles. Going beyond the climatological aspects of the findings, Welander noted that figuring out how the archaeal proteins handle the arcane work of membrane fusing could reveal compelling new biochemistry for potential real-world applications, such as drug discovery and materials science. “Microbes invent all kinds of weird biochemistry to do all kinds of weird reactions,” Welander said. “Anytime you can expand that chemistry of what is possible, it’s really exciting from just a basic science perspective.”  Welander is also a member of Stanford Bio-X.

Stanford,Global analysis of submarine canyons may shed light on Martian landscapes,Science & Technology,2019-10-15,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/08/global-analysis-submarine-canyons-may-shed-light-martian-landscapes/,"   Submarine canyons are a final frontier on planet Earth. There are thousands of these breathtaking geological features hidden within the depths of the ocean – yet scientists have more high-resolution imagery of the surface of Mars than of Earth’s ocean floor.  The Monterey Canyon is one of thousands of submarine canyons hidden on the ocean floor. New research reveals distinct differences from land canyons for the first time. (Image credit: Courtesy Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute)  In an effort to shed light on these mysterious underwater features, Stanford researchers analyzed a collection of global images from an online repository of data from the ocean floor. They found that submarine canyons, which had been believed to form in ways similar to canyons on land, are instead fundamentally different from the land-based ravines that cut through vast stretches of our mountain ranges. The research was published online in Geology Sept. 25. “People would say, ‘Oh well, there is no real difference between the two systems because at the end of the day, a river flowing versus a sediment gravity flow flowing – they’re just going to do the same thing,’” said lead author Stephen Dobbs, a PhD candidate in geological sciences. “And it turns out that’s not necessarily the case.” The researchers analyzed multi-beam sonar data, which is collected by ships or small underwater vehicles just above the sea floor that send a sonar wave that is used to make maps of the seafloor. They acquired data for the study from the Global Multi-Resolution Topography synthesis, an open-source online repository. Dobbs said it was surprising to discover differences in the underwater and above-ground canyons, since on a map, formations 9,000 feet underwater can’t be distinguished from canyons that are 9,000 feet above ground. “When you look from a purely qualitative sense – when you’re just looking at a map – they look shockingly similar,” said Dobbs. “We needed to use a quantitative method to actually test if these are different systems.” The scientists found distinctions in the shapes and profiles of submarine canyons. On land, significant changes in canyon shape are often triggered by large flood events or landslides. Under water, researches hypothesize processes that form submarine canyons are periodic landslides from extreme steepness, seismic activity or large winter storms that funnel a lot of sediment from the shallow continental shelf. “This is all frontier – we don’t actually know the answers to these things,” Dobbs said. “Now we have all these measurements and we can more aptly look at what causes these formations.” From classroom to peer review The student-led research grew out of a graduate seminar exploring submarine canyons held in spring of 2018. The colloquium brought together graduate students from two different laboratories – those of geological sciences professors Don Lowe and Stephan Graham. The research was guided by co-authors George Hilley, a professor of geological sciences, and adjunct professor of geological sciences Tim McHargue, who are both part of Stanford Earth’s sedimentary research group along with Lowe and Graham. Hilley said most people don’t realize that sediment-laden water can erode the seafloor, never mind the fact that these flows have carved features deeper than the Grand Canyon right off the coast of Monterey. Because a lot of high-resolution imagery has been collected in recent years, the faculty members knew it should be possible to analyze a large sampling of the underwater features. “We used the seminar as a vehicle for answering whether or not the forms produced by these density flows share essential characteristics with those produced by rivers,” Hilley said. “By asking these questions using real data, everyone learned how to formulate hypotheses and falsify them using sophisticated data analysis.” While the project was a deviation from the graduate students’ main research projects, Dobbs said he was pleased with how much the group accomplished in one year of pursuing this new topic. Application to Mars? Dobbs said he is excited about the prospect of using these methods to understand not only geology on Earth but also on other planets. For example, it could help researchers understand Martian landscapes, which are pocked with features that may share similarities with Earth’s canyons. The research is also relevant to ocean-dependent industries, including communications companies – whose data cables can be severed by events in submarine canyons – as well as offshore energy and oil and gas operations. “These things have huge impacts on Earth systems and they are fundamentally not understood,” Dobbs said. “We’re just now able to actually measure them in a rigorous geomorphic sense and from that, we’re able to make inferences about both how they form and how they influence our systems and our cycles.” Dobbs plans to continue working with this data set in order to learn more about submarine canyon formation and behavior. “The exciting thing for me is that – while I love fieldwork – we can literally discover new things using very simple tools that are available to the public and open access,” he said.

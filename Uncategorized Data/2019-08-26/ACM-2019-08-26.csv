The researchers demonstrated the new technology with a robotic blooming flower brooch, dancing robotic butterflies, and fluttering leaves on a kinetic work of art. The actuator looks like a strip of paper about an inch long and is made up of MXene, a class of compounds that have layers only a few atoms thick. The researchers found the actuator moved in response to low voltage very quickly, and was able to move continuously for more than five hours.                 "

Developers usually need a bachelor's degree, and programming skills like Java, JavaScript, SQL, C Sharp, Cascading Style Sheets, and NET Framework. Their median annual salary last year was $105,590, or $50.77 an hour, and the profession's job-growth outlook is higher than average. The study predicts the number of jobs for software developers will rise 24% nationwide from 2016 to 2026. An independent study by U.S. News & World Report found software developer was the best job in terms of work-life balance and career development.                 "
ACM,"Artificial Muscles Bloom, Dance, Wave",ACM,2019-08-18,-,https://news.mit.edu/2019/reduce-cost-cloud-infrastructure-0819,"       Using Wall Street Secrets to Reduce the Cost of Cloud Infrastructure     MIT NewsRob MathesonAugust 18, 2019   Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Microsoft have developed a ""risk-aware"" mathematical model that could improve the performance of cloud computing networks around the world. The TeaVar model (whose code is freely available on GitHub) accounts for failure probabilities of links between datacenters worldwide, similar to predicting the volatility of stocks. Then, TeaVar runs an optimization engine to allocate traffic through optimal paths to minimize loss while maximizing overall usage of the network. While conventional methods keep links idle to handle unexpected traffic shifts resulting from link failures, TeaVar guarantees that for a targeted percentage of time the network can handle all data traffic, so there is no need to keep any links idle. During testing based on real-world data, the model supported three times the traffic throughput of traditional traffic-engineering models, while maintaining the same high level of network availability.

The researchers noted the presence of different levels of cross-router covert channels, which can be integrated and taken advantage of to either direct a malicious implant or to exfiltrate data. These flaws in certain cases can be patched as a software bug, but more pervasive and concealed cross-channel communication is impervious to prevention unless data streams are partitioned on different hardware. Said BGU's Adar Ovadya, ""A hardware-based solution seems to be the safest approach to guaranteeing isolation between secure and non-secure network devices.""                 "

For example, signals of gravitational waves collected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory must be matched by supercomputers against hundreds of thousands of templates of potential wave signatures. Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's National Center for Supercomputing Applications used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for real-time detection/decryption of gravitational-wave signals. The team then scaled up the initiative with supercomputer-trained deep learning algorithms, which search through a larger series of parameters to identify overlooked signals. Meanwhile, Harvard University researchers developed a CNN to analyze x-ray images of galaxy clusters, and applied a technique allowing the network's observations to be visualized to give users a better idea of how the CNN was operating.

In higher-level grades in computing, girls outperformed boys, with 24.9% of girls receiving a 7/A grade in the subject compared to 20.8% of boys. Said Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates, ""What is particularly significant is the increase in girls studying STEM subjects, which paints an optimistic future for the tech industry, which has struggled to increase its gender diversity.""

The ShareAR toolkit for the Microsoft HoloLens helps apps produce, share, and monitor objects shared by users. Testing with case study apps revealed that the most computationally rigorous actions were creating objects, and changing permission settings within apps. However, ShareAR took no longer than 5 milliseconds to complete a task—and less than 1 millisecond in most cases—even when researchers intentionally strained the system, with large numbers of users and shared objects.

The researchers created biophysical models of each stage of the sickling (deformation) of cells, including a simulated red blood cell function called OpenRBC, and a supercomputer model of sickle cell fiber formation. The end-product was a kinetic model of the sickling process, with supercomputer-derived data fed into a streamlined iteration enveloping key sickling dynamics, which can run on a laptop. The team demonstrated that the model could replicate the results of earlier experiments, both in the laboratory and in humans. The model allows users to enter the mode of action by which a drug is presumed to function, to view its potential effects on the cells.                 "

EdwardsAugust 16, 2019   Researchers at the University of Maryland's Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) used laser pulses to simultaneously create quantum connections between different pairs of qubits, marking the first time these kinds of parallel operations have been executed in an ion trap. This breakthrough illustrates that advancing ion trap quantum processors is not limited by the physics of qubits, but rather tied to the engineering of their controllers. The new ion trap is made from gold-coated electrodes, which carry the electric fields that confine Ytterbium ions. The ions are caught in the middle of the trap where they form a line, each separated from its neighbor by just a few microns. This configuration allows researchers to control individual ions and set them up as qubits.                 "

The algorithm uses machine learning to learn patterns, remember them, and create data modalities. The system infers 21 three-dimensional keypoints on hands in every frame. The algorithm is made up of three models that work together: a palm detector; a hand detector, and gesture recognition. Rather than tracking the whole hand, the system merely tracks the palm to read overall hand movements. In addition, the position of every finger is analyzed separately to create proper interpretations. Google says it has opened the source code so other researchers can build on its achievement.                 "

IEEE,3 Easy Ways to Evaluate AI Claims,Robotics,2019-08-23,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/learn-the-red-flags-of-overhyped-ai-claims,"      When every other tech startup claims to use artificial intelligence, it can be tough to figure out if an AI service or product works as advertised. In the midst of the AI “gold rush,” how can you separate the nuggets from the fool’s gold?  There’s no shortage of cautionary tales involving overhyped AI claims. And applying AI technologies to health care, education, and law enforcement mean that getting it wrong can have real consequences for society—not just for investors who bet on the wrong unicorn.  So IEEE Spectrum asked experts to share their tips for how to identify AI hype in press releases, news articles, research papers, and IPO filings. “It can be tricky, because I think the people who are out there selling the AI hype—selling this AI snake oil—are getting more sophisticated over time,” says Tim Hwang, director of the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative. The term “AI” is perhaps most frequently used to describe machine learning algorithms (and deep learning algorithms, which require even less human guidance) that analyze huge amounts of data and make predictions based on patterns that humans might miss. These popular forms of AI are mostly suited to specialized tasks, such as automatically recognizing certain objects within photos. For that reason, they are sometimes described as “weak” or “narrow” AI. Some researchers and thought leaders like to talk about the idea of “artificial general intelligence” or “strong AI” that has human-level capacity and flexibility to handle many diverse intellectual tasks. But for now, this type of AI remains firmly in the realm of science fiction and is far from being realized in the real world.  “AI has no well-defined meaning and many so-called AI companies are simply trying to take advantage of the buzz around that term,” says Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University. “Companies have even been caught claiming to use AI when, in fact, the task is done by human workers.” Here are three ways to recognize AI hype.  One red flag is what Hwang calls the “hype salad.” This means stringing together the term “AI” with many other tech buzzwords such as “blockchain” or “Internet of Things.” That doesn’t automatically disqualify the technology, but spotting a high volume of buzzwords in a post, pitch, or presentation should raise questions about what exactly the company or individual has developed. Other experts agree that strings of buzzwords can be a red flag. That’s especially true if the buzzwords are never really explained in technical detail, and are simply tossed around as vague, poorly-defined terms, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, a computer scientist and biomedical engineer at the University of Toronto in Canada. “I think that if it looks like a Google search—picture ‘interpretable blockchain AI deep learning medicine’—it  probably not high-quality work,” Ghassemi says. Hwang also suggests mentally replacing all mentions of “AI” in an article with the term “magical fairy dust.” It’s a way of seeing whether an individual or organization is treating the technology like magic. If so—that’s another good reason to ask more questions about what exactly the AI technology involves. And even the visual imagery used to illustrate AI claims can indicate that an individual or organization is overselling the technology. “I think that a lot of the people who work on machine learning on a day-to-day basis are pretty humble about the technology, because they’re largely confronted with how frequently it just breaks and doesn't work,” Hwang says. “And so I think that if you see a company or someone representing AI as a Terminator head, or a big glowing HAL eye or something like that, I think it’s also worth asking some questions.”              It can be hard to evaluate AI claims without any relevant expertise, says Ghassemi at the University of Toronto. Even experts need to know the technical details of the AI algorithm in question and have some access to the training data that shaped the AI model’s predictions. Still, savvy readers with some basic knowledge of applied statistics can search for red flags. To start, readers can look for possible bias in training data based on small sample sizes or a skewed population that fails to reflect the broader population, Ghassemi says. After all, an AI model trained only on health data from white men would not necessarily achieve similar results for other populations of patients.  How machine learning and deep learning models perform also depends on how well humans labeled the sample datasets use to train these programs. This task can be straightforward when labeling photos of cats versus dogs, but gets more complicated when assigning disease diagnoses to certain patient cases.  Medical experts frequently disagree with each other on diagnoses—which is why many patients seek a second opinion. Not surprisingly, this ambiguity can also affect the diagnostic labels that experts assign in training datasets. “For me, a red flag is not demonstrating deep knowledge of how your labels are defined,” Ghassemi says. Such training data can also reflect the cultural stereotypes and biases of the humans who labeled the data, says Narayanan at Princeton University. Like Ghassemi, he recommends taking a hard look at exactly what the AI has learned: “A good way to start critically evaluating AI claims is by asking questions about the training data.” Another red flag is presenting an AI system’s performance through a single accuracy figure without much explanation, Narayanan says. Claiming that an AI model achieves “99 percent” accuracy doesn’t mean much without knowing the baseline for comparison—such as whether other systems have already achieved 99 percent accuracy—or how well that accuracy holds up in situations beyond the training dataset. Narayanan also emphasized the need to ask questions about an AI model’s false positive rate—the rate of making wrong predictions about the presence of a given condition. Even if the false positive rate of a hypothetical AI service is just one percent, that could have major consequences if that service ends up screening millions of people for cancer. Readers can also consider whether using AI in a given situation offers any meaningful improvement compared to traditional statistical methods, says Clayton Aldern, a data scientist and journalist who serves as managing director for Caldern LLC. He gave the hypothetical example of a “super-duper-fancy deep learning model” that achieves a prediction accuracy of 89 percent, compared to a “little polynomial regression model” that achieves 86 percent on the same dataset. “We're talking about a three-percentage-point increase on something that you learned about in Algebra 1,” Aldern says. “So is it worth the hype?”  The hype surrounding AI isn’t just about the technical merits of services and products driven by machine learning. Overblown claims about the beneficial  impacts of AI technology—or vague promises to address ethical issues related to deploying it—should also raise red flags. “If a company promises to use its tech ethically, it is important to question if its business model aligns with that promise,” Narayanan says. “Even if employees have noble intentions, it is unrealistic to expect the company as a whole to resist financial imperatives.” One example might be a company with a business model that depends on leveraging customers’ personal data. Such companies “tend to make empty promises when it comes to privacy,” Narayanan says. And, if companies hire workers to produce training data, it’s also worth asking whether the companies treat those workers ethically. The transparency—or lack thereof—about any AI claim can also be telling. A company or research group can minimize concerns by publishing technical claims in peer-reviewed journals or allowing credible third parties to evaluate their AI without giving away big intellectual property secrets, Narayanan says. Excessive secrecy is a big red flag. With these strategies, you don’t need to be a computer engineer or data scientist to start thinking critically about AI claims. And, Narayanan says, the world needs many people from different backgrounds for societies to fully consider the real-world implications of AI.

IEEE,"To Stop Transformers From Exploding, Make Their Tanks Flexible",Energy,2019-08-23,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/to-stop-transformers-from-exploding-make-their-tanks-flexible,"      When an eerie blue glow lit up the sky above New York City last December, some were disappointed to learn that aliens weren’t involved. The cause was, in fact, terrestrial: a transformer had exploded at a local power plant.  For the most part, transformers—which help power companies transmit electricity efficiently by altering voltages—are relatively safe. Fewer than one percent explode—but those explosions can be deadly, and result in flying projectiles, toxic fires, or oil spills. Transformers rupture due to a buildup of excess pressure in the tank in which they are encased, which is usually filled with mineral oil that acts as a coolant. Contaminants within the oil, the degradation of transformer parts, and electrical storms can all cause a fault, called an internal arc, that results in a rapid release of energy.  “When you have an arc inside the transformer, it heats up the oil and the oil burns to create a gas, which causes high pressure,” explains Samuel Brodeur, a senior mechanical engineer at the power and technology firm ABB, who is based in Varennes, Canada. Conventional tank designs are limited in their capacity to withstand such fault energies—which in severe cases, can reach as high as 150 megajoules (MJ), the equivalent of 150 sticks of dynamite—and so Brodeur and his colleagues have spent the past seven years working to devise a stronger, more resilient transformer tank. Their solution, described in a paper published 12 June in IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, is called TXpand. The idea is startlingly simple: design a tank that’s flexible enough to deform to absorb all that extra pressure without rupturing. “It’s a bit like blowing [up] a balloon,” says Jean-Bernard Dastous, a research scientist from Canadian power supplier Hydro-Québec, which collaborated with ABB on the project. “If it’s very rigid, it will be difficult to expand the balloon. But if it’s made of a very flexible material, it’s easier for you to inflate it.” ABB, which currently supplies roughly 70 percent of Hydro-Québec’s transformers, alters tank flexibility by using different types of steel, varying the thickness of the wall and cover, and reinforcing weak points such as the corners, among other things. To design what ABB calls an “arc resistant” tank, the team first had to create a mechanical model that could predict the pressure at which a given tank would deform and subsequently rupture, based on its size and material properties. Hydro-Québec, in particular, wanted ABB to build a tank that could withstand 20 MJ of energy without rupturing—a level that would cause a “catastrophic failure” in most transformers and one that Dastous says “would cover 95 percent of faults occurring on the network.” And so ABB plugged equations into its numerical model and spent months building a full-size tank (roughly 5 meters long, 2.5 meters wide, and 4 meters high). For safety reasons, the tank was filled with water instead of oil, and contained a replica of the active part of a transformer. The first test, carried out on a frigid winter’s day in November 2017 in an open field at Hydro-Québec’s research facilities close to Montreal, was meant to demonstrate the tank could withstand the specified 20 MJ. Until then, the highest energy levels tested were just over half that value. The team injected pressurized air measuring 200 atmospheres, which is equivalent to the pressure experienced two kilometers below sea level. The tank bulged at its sides, but did not explode. The second test, they hoped, would demonstrate that at a given pressure, the tank would rupture at a chosen point. “We wanted to make sure that failure happens at the top of the transformer because when it happens there, less oil will spill into the environment,” explains Dastous.  Following an injection of 30 MJ of energy, the test tank did exactly this, proving that “our calculations and numerical test methodologies worked,” he says. The results have enabled Hydro-Québec to come up with “new improved arc-resistant specifications” for its suppliers to follow. The specifications, to be implemented in the coming months, will hopefully lead to fewer transformers exploding. ABB, on the other hand, has since applied its TXpand solution to more than 50 transformer designs. Brodeur says: “Because we are able to prevent most of the tank rupture cases, it’s safer for the people who work around the transformer and it’s also very good for the environment because we can prevent major oil spills and toxic fires.”  Monthly newsletter on latest news & opinion for the power & energy industry, green technology, and conservation.

IEEE,Video Friday: AlienGo Quadruped Robot Can Now Do Backflips,Robotics,2019-08-23,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/video-friday-unitree-robotics-aliengo-quadruped-robot,"      Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your Automaton bloggers. We’ll also be posting a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months; here’s what we have so far (send us your events!): Let us know if you have suggestions for next week, and enjoy today’s videos. I know you’ve all been closely following our DARPA Subterranean Challenge coverage here and on Twitter, but here are short recap videos of each day just in case you missed something.        [ DARPA SubT ]   After Laikago, Unitree Robotics is now introducing AlienGo, which is looking mighty spry:    We’ve seen MIT’s Mini Cheetah doing backflips earlier this year, but apparently AlienGo is now the largest and heaviest quadruped to perform the maneuver. [ Unitree ]   The majority of soft robots today rely on external power and control, keeping them tethered to off-board systems or rigged with hard components. Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Caltech have developed soft robotic systems, inspired by origami, that can move and change shape in response to external stimuli, paving the way for fully untethered soft robots.    The Rollbot begins as a flat sheet, about 8 centimeters long and 4 centimeters wide. When placed on a hot surface, about 200°C, one set of hinges folds and the robot curls into a pentagonal wheel.  Another set of hinges is embedded on each of the five sides of the wheel. A hinge folds when in contact with the hot surface, propelling the wheel to turn to the next side, where the next hinge folds. As they roll off the hot surface, the hinges unfold and are ready for the next cycle. [ Harvard SEAS ]   A new research effort at Caltech aims to help people walk again by combining exoskeletons with spinal stimulation. This initiative, dubbed RoAM (Robotic Assisted Mobility), combines the research of two Caltech roboticists: Aaron Ames, who creates the algorithms that enable walking by bipedal robots and translates these to govern the motion of exoskeletons and prostheses; and Joel Burdick, whose transcutaneous spinal implants have already helped paraplegics in clinical trials to recover some leg function and, crucially, torso control.    [ Caltech ]   Once ExoMars lands, it’s going to have to get itself off of the descent stage and onto the surface, which could be tricky. But practice makes perfect, or as near as you can get on Earth.    That wheel walking technique is pretty cool, and it looks like ExoMars will be able to handle terrain that would scare NASA’s Mars rovers away. [ ExoMars ]   I am honestly not sure whether this would make the game of golf more or less fun to watch:    [ Nissan ]   Finally, a really exciting use case for Misty!    It can pick up those balls too, right? [ Misty ]   You know you’re an actual robot if this video doesn’t make you crave Peeps.    [ Soft Robotics ]   COMANOID investigates the deployment of robotic solutions in well-identified Airbus airliner assembly operations that are tedious for human workers and for which access is impossible for wheeled or rail-ported robotic platforms. This video presents a demonstration of autonomous placement of a part inside the aircraft fuselage. The task is performed by TORO, the torque-controlled humanoid robot developed at DLR.    [ COMANOID ]   It’s a little hard to see in this video, but this is a cable-suspended robot arm that has little tiny robot arms that it waves around to help damp down vibrations.    [ CoGiRo  ]     This week in Robots in Depth, Per speaks with author Cristina Andersson.    In 2013 she organized events in Finland during European robotics week and found that many people was very interested but that there was also a big lack of knowledge. She also talks about introducing robotics in society in a way that makes it easy for everyone to understand the benefits as this will make the process much easier. When people see the clear benefits in one field or situation they will be much more interested in bringing robotics in to their private or professional lives.

IEEE,ANYbotics Introduces Sleek New ANYmal C Quadruped,Robotics,2019-08-23,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/anybotics-introduces-sleek-new-anymal-c-quadruped,"      Quadrupedal robots are making significant advances lately, and just in the past few months we’ve seen Boston Dynamics’ Spot hauling a truck, IIT’s HyQReal pulling a plane, MIT’s MiniCheetah doing backflips, Unitree Robotics’ Laikago towing a van, and Ghost Robotics’ Vision 60 exploring a mine. Robot makers are betting that their four-legged machines will prove useful in a variety of applications in construction, security, delivery, and even at home. ANYbotics has been working on such applications for years, testing out their ANYmal robot in places where humans typically don’t want to go (like offshore platforms) as well as places where humans really don’t want to go (like sewers), and they have a better idea than most companies what can make quadruped robots successful. This week, ANYbotics is announcing a completely new quadruped platform, ANYmal C, a major upgrade from the really quite research-y ANYmal B. The new quadruped has been optimized for ruggedness and reliability in industrial environments, with a streamlined body painted a color that lets you know it means business.   ANYmal C’s physical specs are pretty impressive for a production quadruped. It can move at 1 meter per second, manage 20-degree slopes and 45-degree stairs, cross 25-centimeter gaps, and squeeze through passages just 60 centimeters wide. It’s packed with cameras and 3D sensors, including a lidar for 3D mapping and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). All these sensors (along with the vast volume of gait research that’s been done with ANYmal) make this one of the most reliably autonomous quadrupeds out there, with real-time motion planning and obstacle avoidance. ANYmal C is also one of the ruggedest legged robots in existence. The 50-kilogram robot is IP67 rated, meaning that it’s completely impervious to dust and can withstand being submerged in a meter of water for an hour. If it’s submerged for longer than that, you’re absolutely doing something wrong. The robot will run for over 2 hours on battery power, and if that’s not enough endurance, don’t worry, because ANYmal can autonomously impale itself on a weird cone-shaped docking station to recharge.  As far as what ANYmal C is designed to actually do, it’s mostly remote inspection tasks where you need to move around through a relatively complex environment, but where for whatever reason you’d be better off not sending a human. ANYmal C has a sensor payload that gives it lots of visual options, like thermal imaging, and with the ability to handle a 10-kilogram payload, the robot can be adapted to many different environments. Over the next few months, we’re hoping to see more examples of ANYmal C being deployed to do useful stuff in real-world environments, but for now, we do have a bit more detail from ANYbotics CTO Christian Gehring. IEEE Spectrum: Can you tell us about the development process for ANYmal C? Christian Gehring: We tested the previous generation of ANYmal (B) in a broad range of environments over the last few years and gained a lot of insights. Based on our learnings, it became clear that we would have to re-design the robot to meet the requirements of industrial customers in terms of safety, quality, reliability, and lifetime. There were different prototype stages both for the new drives and for single robot assemblies. Apart from electrical tests, we thoroughly tested the thermal control and ingress protection of various subsystems like the depth cameras and actuators.  What can ANYmal C do that the previous version of ANYmal can’t? ANYmal C was redesigned with a focus on performance increase regarding actuation (new drives), computational power (new hexacore Intel i7 PCs), locomotion and navigation skills, and autonomy (new depth cameras). The new robot additionally features a docking system for autonomous recharging and an inspection payload as an option. The design of ANYmal C is far more integrated than its predecessor, which increases both performance and reliability. How much of ANYmal C’s development and design was driven by your experience with commercial or industry customers? Tests (such as the offshore installation with TenneT) and discussions with industry customers were important to get the necessary design input in terms of performance, safety, quality, reliability, and lifetime. Most customers ask for very similar inspection tasks that can be performed with our standard inspection payload and the required software packages. Some are looking for a robot that can also solve some simple manipulation tasks like pushing a button. Overall, most use cases customers have in mind are realistic and achievable, but some are really tough for the robot, like climbing 50° stairs in hot environments of 50°C. Can you describe how much autonomy you expect ANYmal C to have in industrial or commercial operations? ANYmal C is primarily developed to perform autonomous routine inspections in industrial environments. This autonomy especially adds value for operations that are difficult to access, as human operation is extremely costly. The robot can naturally also be operated via a remote control and we are working on long-distance remote operation as well.  Do you expect that researchers will be interested in ANYmal C? What research applications could it be useful for? ANYmal C has been designed to also address the needs of the research community. The robot comes with two powerful hexacore Intel i7 computers and can additionally be equipped with an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier graphics card for learning-based applications. Payload interfaces enable users to easily install and test new sensors. By joining our established ANYmal Research community, researchers get access to simulation tools and software APIs, which boosts their research in various areas like control, machine learning, and navigation.

The Ray lab and the city of Peachtree Corners enlisted an 18-mile segment of I-85, with access to fiber optics and 5G networks, for exploring the performance of future autonomous vehicles on urban and rural roads, via a test track. Peachtree Corners' Curiosity Lab will investigate reduced speeds and pedestrian encounters. Peachtree Corners city manager Brian Johnson said, ""All of it is going to be tied in through the city's own fiber-optic network that we own into a network operations center so all of this will be and under video surveillance."" The Ray is working with the Georgia Transportation Department on a platform for managing data culled from connected vehicles with roadside equipment. The Ray's Allie Kelly said data from the platform and Peachtree Corners ""can be shared with our data management system, and we can help Peachtree Corners have some informed insight into that data strength.""

A recent International Data Corp. survey of about 400 retailers from around the world found that 28% are testing or piloting cashierless AI systems. For example, Sam's Club plans to offer AI-powered cashierless shopping later this month at a 32,000-square-foot store in Dallas, Texas. After the AI system is in place, customers will use their smartphone cameras to scan a product; the cloud-based system will use computer vision and machine learning to recognize the products by matching them to a database of stored images.

An external device, such as a laptop, uses PTP to ask the camera for pictures and other information, and the camera responds with the requested information. Itkin found that by sending specific requests, he could take control of the camera. The hack can occur via two methods: an attacker could place a fake public Wi-Fi access point in a public location and then take control of any camera that connects to it; or if the camera is plugged into a computer that an attacker already has control of or has infected with malware.

Apple worked with the New Museum to select artists to create an AR work that has been choreographed into the landscape of the tour, using public space as a canvas. The walking tours will be free and open to the public, and similar events will be offered in San Francisco, London, Paris, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Viewers will be provided with headphones and an iPhone; along the route, in specific places, works of art appear on the screen against the backdrop of the viewer's surroundings. Said New Museum director Lisa Phillips, ""The New Museum has always led at the intersection of art and tech and we could not have asked for a better partner in Apple to support the fantastic visions of these pioneering artists.""

The researchers generated millions of different simulated universes on a supercomputer, each of which obeyed different physical theories for how galaxies should form. The team evaluated each simulated universe to determine how similar galaxies appeared compared to the true universe. The universes most like our own all had similar underlying physical rules, demonstrating a powerful new approach for studying galaxy formation. The researchers utilized computing resources at the Ames Research Center, the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, and the ""Ocelote"" supercomputer at the UA High Performance Computing cluster. Two-thousand processors analyzed the data simultaneously over three weeks, generating more than 8 million simulated universes.                 "

ZDNetEileen BrownAugust 9, 2019   Typing.com analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to evaluate progress in closing the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields across the U.S. Not one state had women outnumbering men in STEM fields, and New York ranked second among states with the smallest gender gap in STEM degrees. Washington, D.C., ranked first, with a gender gap slightly under 7%, while Wyoming made the most headway of any state, shrinking the STEM worker gender gap by 18.2% between 2015 and 2017. The lowest gender gap among STEM employees nationwide was in D.C., at 13.8%. Meanwhile, Rhode Island's gender gap has risen 21.6% since 2015—the highest in the U.S.—followed by Delaware, with a 10.4% wider gap in STEM gender pay.                 "

The computational tool predictively models robotic motions (which are designed by animators) that suppress vibrations. Afterward, the tool commands the motors to make small, additional motions to cancel out those vibrations, without interfering with the robot's intended movements. The methodology's efficacy greatly relies on the accuracy of the robot model. To accommodate the challenge of dealing with increasingly complex robotic characters, the researchers prioritize damping out the most visible large-amplitude vibrations.                 "

The researchers invented an interface that shows words the computer uses as a basis for its guesses as a person types a question, then edits the question to exploit weaknesses. The researchers compiled a dataset of 1,213 questions that humans can easily answer, yet are beyond the capabilities of the best modern computer-answering systems. UMD's Jordan Boyd-Graber said tests on the dataset ""will reveal if a computer language system is actually reading and doing the same sorts of processing that humans are able to do."" A computer that masters these questions will be better enabled to understand language than any current system, and the dataset also could be used to train improved machine learning algorithms.

A cat state—named after the Schrodinger's cat analogy—is a quantum state with two diametrically opposed conditions, existing simultaneously. The team generated the cat-state qubits via a programmable quantum simulator, establishing a new record that supports validity, even if other physical strategies with optical photons, trapped ions, or superconducting quantum circuits are accounted for. Said Julich's Jian Cui, ""The secret of the enormous efficiency and performance expected of future quantum computers is to be found in this superposition of states."" The creation of 20 qubits means the number of superimposed states surpasses one million.                 "

The avatar, Barry, is a virtual worker, whose body language, voice, and other expressions can guide trainees as they interact with him in a firing situation. Tailspin CEO Kyle Jackson says, ""We are seeing repeated interest in building training products around interviewing skills, navigating difficult conversations, consultative selling, performance reviews, and identifying diversity and inclusion best practices, to name a few."" Jackson added that the Barry avatar follows a set script, precluding the character from natural engagement with trainees.                 "

The researchers used a rogue engineering workstation that posed as a Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal engineering framework, to engage the Simatic S7-1500 PLC governing an industrial system. TAU's Avishai Wool said, ""The station was able to remotely start and stop the PLC via the commandeered Siemens communications architecture, potentially wreaking havoc on an industrial process.

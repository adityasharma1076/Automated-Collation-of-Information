Stanford,Wireless sensors stick to skin and track health,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/16/wireless-sensors-stick-skin-track-health/,"   We tend to take our skin’s protective function for granted, ignoring its other roles in signaling subtleties like a fluttering heart or a flush of embarrassment.  Using metallic ink, researchers screen-print an antenna and sensor onto a stretchable sticker designed to adhere to skin and track pulse and other health indicators, and beam these readings to a receiver on a person’s clothing. (Image credit: Bao Lab)  Now, Stanford engineers have developed a way to detect physiological signals emanating from the skin with sensors that stick like band-aids and beam wireless readings to a receiver clipped onto clothing. To demonstrate this wearable technology, the researchers stuck sensors to the wrist and abdomen of one test subject to monitor the person’s pulse and respiration by detecting how their skin stretched and contracted with each heartbeat or breath. Likewise, stickers on the person’s elbows and knees tracked arm and leg motions by gauging the minute tightening or relaxation of the skin each time the corresponding muscle flexed. Zhenan Bao, the chemical engineering professor whose lab described the system in an Aug. 15 article in Nature Electronics, thinks this wearable technology, which they call BodyNet, will first be used in medical settings such as monitoring patients with sleep disorders or heart conditions. Her lab is already trying to develop new stickers to sense sweat and other secretions to track variables such as body temperature and stress. Her ultimate goal is to create an array of wireless sensors that stick to the skin and work in conjunction with smart clothing to more accurately track a wider variety of health indicators than the smart phones or watches consumers use today. “We think one day it will be possible to create a full-body skin-sensor array to collect physiological data without interfering with a person’s normal behavior,” said Bao, who is also the K.K. Lee Professor in the School of Engineering. Stretchable, comfortable, functional Postdoctoral scholars Simiao Niu and Naoji Matsuhisa led the 14-person team that spent three years designing the sensors. Their goal was to develop a technology that would be comfortable to wear and have no batteries or rigid circuits to prevent the stickers from stretching and contracting with the skin. Their eventual design met these parameters with a variation of the RFID – radiofrequency identification – technology used to control keyless entry to locked rooms. When a person holds an ID card up to an RFID receiver, an antenna in the ID card harvests a tiny bit of RFID energy from the receiver and uses this to generate a code that it then beams back to the receiver.  The rubber sticker attached to the wrist can bend and stretch as the person’s skin moves, beaming pulse readings to a receiver clipped to the person’s clothing. (Image credit: Bao Lab)  The BodyNet sticker is similar to the ID card: It has an antenna that harvests a bit of the incoming RFID energy from a receiver on the clothing to power its sensors. It then takes readings from the skin and beams them back to the nearby receiver. But to make the wireless sticker work, the researchers had to create an antenna that could stretch and bend like skin. They did this by screen-printing metallic ink on a rubber sticker. However, whenever the antenna bent or stretched, those movements made its signal too weak and unstable to be useful. To get around this problem, the Stanford researchers developed a new type of RFID system that could beam strong and accurate signals to the receiver despite constant fluctuations. The battery-powered receiver then uses Bluetooth to periodically upload data from the stickers to a smartphone, computer or other permanent storage system. The initial version of the stickers relied on tiny motion sensors to take respiration and pulse readings. The researchers are now studying how to integrate sweat, temperature and other sensors into their antenna systems. To move their technology beyond clinical applications and into consumer-friendly devices, the researchers need to overcome another challenge – keeping the sensor and receiver close to each other. In their experiments, the researchers clipped a receiver on clothing just above each sensor. One-to-one pairings of sensors and receivers would be fine in medical monitoring, but to create a BodyNet that someone could wear while exercising, antennas would have to be woven into clothing to receive and transmit signals no matter where a person sticks a sensor.

Stanford,Atomically thin heat shield protects electronics,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/16/atomically-thin-heat-shield-protects-electronics/,"   Excess heat given off by smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices can be annoying, but beyond that it contributes to malfunctions and, in extreme cases, can even cause lithium batteries to explode.  This greatly magnified image shows four layers of atomically thin materials that form a heat-shield just two to three nanometers thick, or roughly 50,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper. (Image credit: National Institute of Standards and Technology)  To guard against such ills, engineers often insert glass, plastic or even layers of air as insulation to prevent heat-generating components like microprocessors from causing damage or discomforting users. Now, Stanford researchers have shown that a few layers of atomically thin materials, stacked like sheets of paper atop hot spots, can provide the same insulation as a sheet of glass 100 times thicker. In the near term, thinner heat shields will enable engineers to make electronic devices even more compact than those we have today, said Eric Pop, professor of electrical engineering and senior author of a paper published Aug. 16 in Science Advances. “We’re looking at the heat in electronic devices in an entirely new way,” Pop said. Detecting sound as heat The heat we feel from smartphones or laptops is actually an inaudible form of high-frequency sound. If that seems crazy, consider the underlying physics. Electricity flows through wires as a stream of electrons. As these electrons move, they collide with the atoms of the materials through which they pass. With each such collision an electron causes an atom to vibrate, and the more current flows, the more collisions occur, until electrons are beating on atoms like so many hammers on so many bells – except that this cacophony of vibrations moves through the solid material at frequencies far above the threshold of hearing, generating energy that we feel as heat. Thinking about heat as a form of sound inspired the Stanford researchers to borrow some principles from the physical world. From his days as a radio DJ at Stanford’s KZSU 90.1 FM, Pop knew that music recording studios are quiet thanks to thick glass windows that block the exterior sound. A similar principle applies to the heat shields in today’s electronics. If better insulation were their only concern, the researchers could simply borrow the music studio principle and thicken their heat barriers. But that would frustrate efforts to make electronics thinner. Their solution was to borrow a trick from homeowners, who install multi-paned windows – usually, layers of air between sheets of glass with varying thickness – to make interiors warmer and quieter. “We adapted that idea by creating an insulator that used several layers of atomically thin materials instead of a thick mass of glass,” said postdoctoral scholar Sam Vaziri, the lead author on the paper. Atomically thin materials are a relatively recent discovery. It was only 15 years ago that scientists were able to isolate some materials into such thin layers. The first example discovered was graphene, which is a single layer of carbon atoms and, ever since it was found, scientists have been looking for, and experimenting with, other sheet-like materials. The Stanford team used a layer of graphene and three other sheet-like materials – each three atoms thick – to create a four-layered insulator just 10 atoms deep. Despite its thinness, the insulator is effective because the atomic heat vibrations are dampened and lose much of their energy as they pass through each layer. To make nanoscale heat shields practical, the researchers will have to find some mass production technique to spray or otherwise deposit atom-thin layers of materials onto electronic components during manufacturing. But behind the immediate goal of developing thinner insulators looms a larger ambition: Scientists hope to one day control the vibrational energy inside materials the way they now control electricity and light. As they come to understand the heat in solid objects as a form of sound, a new field of phononics is emerging, a name taken from the Greek root word behind telephone, phonograph and phonetics. “As engineers, we know quite a lot about how to control electricity, and we’re getting better with light, but we’re just starting to understand how to manipulate the high-frequency sound that manifests itself as heat at the atomic scale,” Pop said.

Stanford,Q&A: How the catalytic converters in cars go bad and why it matters,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/qa-how-catalytic-converters-cars-go-bad-and-why-it-matters,"  Modern cars rely on catalytic converters to remove carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other harmful chemicals from exhaust emissions. To do so they rely on costly metals that have special chemical properties that diminish in effectiveness over time. Assistant professor Matteo Cargnello and doctoral candidate Emmett Goodman recently led a team that has proposed a new way to reduce the cost and extend the lifespan of these materials, solving a problem that has vexed automotive engineers for years. In the process, Cargnello and colleagues have done something remarkable: made a breakthrough in a mature field where change comes slowly, if at all. What about catalytic converters needs to be improved? A new catalytic converter can cost $1,000 or more, making it among the most expensive individual parts on any car. They are costly because they use expensive metals such as palladium to promote the chemical reactions that cleanse the exhaust. Palladium costs about $50 a gram — more than gold — and each catalytic converter contains about 5 grams of it. Metals like palladium are catalysts — a special class of materials that speed up chemical reactions but don’t chemically change themselves. In theory, catalysts can be used over and over, indefinitely. In practice, however, the performance of catalysts degrades over time. To compensate, we are forced to use more of these expensive metals up front, adding to the cost. Our goal is to better understand the causes of this degradation and how to counteract it. Why do catalysts go bad? Ideally, catalysts should be designed to have the greatest surface area possible to promote the greatest number of chemical reactions. So, manufacturers typically spread many small particles over the surface of a new catalytic converter. From past research we know that, over time, the metal atoms begin to move, forming larger and larger particles that offer less surface area, and thus become less effective. We call this clumping process “sintering.” To counteract sintering, manufacturers use excessive amounts of metal so that the converter will meet emissions standards for the 10- or 15-year lifespan of a car. Our team has discovered that sintering isn’t the only cause of deactivation. In fact, this new deactivation mechanism turns out to be quite the opposite of sintering. Under some circumstances, instead of particles getting larger, they decompose into smaller particles and eventually become single atoms that are essentially inactive. This is a new understanding we believe no one has presented before, and it prompted us to look for an entirely new way to maximize the lifespan and performance of the metals in catalytic converters. What can we do to make catalysts last longer? Our research suggests that if we carefully control both the size and the spacing of metal particles, palladium particles will neither sinter into large clumps nor decompose into single atoms. Previously, many people in the catalysis community thought that if you want to make particles stable, you had to keep them as far apart as possible to prevent migration of the particles. We confounded this notion by bringing together a collaborative team that studied degradation in a new way. Aaron Johnston-Peck from the National Institute of Standards and Technology used advanced microscopy to help visualize the presence of the single atoms. Simon Bare from the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used X-ray techniques to prove that catalytic materials start as particles and end up as single atoms. To put these experimental results in a theoretical framework, we worked with Frank Abild-Pedersen from the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis and SLAC, and Philipp Plessow from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. They had the computational resources to help us simulate the deactivation mechanism at the atomic scale. In the end, we’ve provided a scientific basis that could make it possible to maintain pollution reduction while using less precious metal and lowering the costs of catalytic converters. If automotive engineers ultimately confirm and implement these findings, it would be a huge win for consumers in the long run.

Stanford,Making physics more inclusive,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/14/making-physics-inclusive/,"   It was no surprise when, in 2016, a Stanford University survey of undergraduates revealed physics as among the least diverse departments at the university – also the case for physics as an academic field nationally. But, deeper analysis of the survey responses revealed a telling and crucial difference between the answers from incoming students and those on their way to graduation.  Students in the spring break program “Physics Outreach through Inclusive Science Education” (POISE) during a trip to Monterey, where they visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium. (Image credit: Courtesy of Josie Meyer)  “Many students from all backgrounds and identities come to Stanford excited about physics, and this interest does not strongly depend on race or gender. But we lose a larger number of Black, Latinx and Native students, as well as women of all races, in the first two years of undergraduate study,” said Risa Wechsler, a professor of physics and of particle physics and astrophysics at Stanford University. “A lot of that is due to the lack of community and overall climate. People from underrepresented groups often do not feel welcome in physics classes.” For Wechsler, who is also director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, this issue is personal. Even she experienced doubts about her place in physics early in her studies and career. To address this problem head on, Wechsler and six other physics faculty members formed the Equity and Inclusion Committee, which also includes students, research staff and postdoctoral scholars. While the committee was formulating a strategic plan, students formed the group Physics Undergraduate Women and Gender Minorities at Stanford (PUWMAS) and Wechsler joined Heising-Simons Foundation’s Physics and Astronomy Leadership Council. That position, which aims to help the foundation diversify physics in the United States, provided her with grant money that she could use to fund local projects. The fact that these efforts are helmed and helped along by so many people, representing various areas of the Physics Department, reflects a larger trend in the field. “In the last five to eight years, there’s been a growing awareness about the importance of identity within the physics community,” said Lauren Tompkins, assistant professor of physics and member of the Equity and Inclusion Committee. “Your identity affects your experience as a physicist and even the physics that you do. If we can acknowledge and understand that, it makes us better physicists.” Groups, classes and a book club PUWMAS was one of the earliest results of this current push for more inclusive physics at Stanford. Undergraduates Deepti Kannan, Nicel Mohamed-Hinds and Manisha Patel founded the group with the mission to “promote diversity in physics by uniting and uplifting minority voices” and “provide opportunities for personal, academic and career development.” In service of these missions, the group organizes social events, a lunchtime speaker series, a mentorship program and professional development workshops on topics such as CV/resume writing, negotiation and interviewing.   Other inclusive efforts Physics 41E: The same as Physics 41: Mechanics, which is a required course for physics majors, but with added support. Students from underrepresented groups often don’t have the same level of preparation from high school as their majority peers. The difference in preparation is large enough that it may lead students to drop out of the major but small enough that the kind of support offered by this course can be enough to keep them in. Physics 94SI: Diverse Perspectives in Physics: A seminar course, also initiated by Meyer and Patel, where physics faculty members from diverse backgrounds share the story of their lives and careers. This course meets over lunch and includes Q&A sessions after each presentation. Rising Stars in Physics: Stanford and MIT co-sponsor this workshop that brings together top early career women in physics and astronomy who are interested in careers in academia. The two-day workshop includes research presentations, panels on issues relevant to academic careers and informal networking opportunities.  “Developing this kind of group involves risk and took incredible effort but it has paid off,” said Wechsler. “It’s only two years old and I feel like they have transformed the atmosphere for undergrads in the department.” In 2018, PUWMAS won an Office of Student Engagement Campus Impact Award. Upon their graduation this year, the founders received the department’s first-ever Departmental Service Award for their efforts. Amidst the success of PUWMAS, co-founder Patel and inaugural director of diversity and education Josie Meyer, BS ’19, brought Wechsler and Tompkins another idea for further development, focused on the fact that students who leave the department often do so between winter and spring quarter. Led by Meyer and Patel, and advised by Tompkins and Wechsler, the team created a pair of initiatives. Physics 93SI: Beyond the Laboratory: Physics, Identity and Society is a new student-taught course that explores issues of diversity and culture in physics directly, drawing directly from disciplines as varied as history, anthropology and critical race theory. Physics Outreach through Inclusive Science Education (POISE) is an optional extension of the course where students spend spring break developing an hour-long workshop for high school students while learning and applying lessons about inclusion in science. “We want the students to see that they can pursue their love of physics and still make a social impact in the world,” said Meyer. “One reason for leaving the department frequently cited by underrepresented minorities is that they feel physics is not relevant to their communities, and I hope POISE changes that.” POISE was offered for the first time in 2019, supported by Wechsler’s Heising-Simons funding. It included field trips to Bay Area museums, labs, companies and Pinnacles National Park. At the end, students taught workshops about the physics of sound and music, spacetime and the universe, and the physics of earthquakes to students at San Lorenzo High School. One unintended advantage was that all of the POISE students were in their first or last years of undergraduate study, which created natural opportunities for mentorship and access to perspectives from students who were in high school last year. “Having a science class where students were asked to reflect about their experience allowed them to bring their whole selves to their work in a way that was empowering,” said Tompkins, who is the faculty advisor for 93SI, POISE, PUWMAS and the Stanford University Physics Society. In a broader effort, the Equity and Inclusion Committee also created the Equity and Inclusion reading group, which has met twice a quarter since early 2018 and is open to anyone interested in equity in STEM. Each meeting features a speaker from the department talking about themes related to the latest reading. Just the beginning Now, Meyer, Tompkins and Wechsler are assessing how the first year of POISE went and what it might look like in 2021. They have also been interested in efforts centered on incoming potential physics students. Ideally, students would know right away about the community the department is building and improving – and reach out to the department about what more they might do.  POISE students at San Lorenzo High School, where they presented their teaching projects. (Image credit: Courtesy of Josie Meyer)  “We want to have the best people in the world involved in this research, but also I really believe that it is a human right to understand how the universe came to be,” said Wechsler. “So, we need to think very deliberately about having a scientific community that includes the whole world’s population. And we’re not there.” Meyer graduated in June but stayed over the summer as the department’s Equity and Inclusion intern. Some of her work so far has included developing training for future POISE leaders, constructing a “Tools for Practical Allyship” workshop series and developing a midterm assessment for progress on the Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. “Students should feel empowered to create positive change within the Stanford physics department and for the rest of their careers,” she said. “Over the past few years, undergraduate students have led the way toward a more inclusive climate in the physics community and I hope we can inspire the next generation of leaders to do the same.” To read all stories about Stanford science, subscribe to the biweekly Stanford Science Digest.

Stanford,Stanford launches major effort to harness the microbiome to treat disease,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/13/stanford-launches-major-effort-harness-microbiome-treat-disease/,"   Stanford is launching a major new effort to harness the communities of microbes inhabiting our bodies – known as the microbiome – in developing new therapies for debilitating diseases. The Stanford Microbiome Therapies Initiative (MITI), a joint initiative between Stanford ChEM-H and the Department of Bioengineering, is backed by a $10 million gift from philanthropists Marc and Lynne Benioff and a $7 million gift from Mark and Debra Leslie.  Michael Fischbach will lead the Stanford Microbiome Therapies Initiative, a joint initiative between ChEM-H and the Department of Bioengineering. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)  The initiative has an ambitious goal of building and manipulating the microbiome to create new therapies and test them in early-stage human clinical trials. “Microbiome science has great potential for advancing our understanding and treatment of human disease,” said Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne. “Stanford faculty are studying the microbes that inhabit our bodies in health and disease and developing platforms to generate new therapies. This body of work creates a foundation for the Stanford Microbiome Therapies Initiative, which will foster interdisciplinary collaborations across the university to spark discoveries that will benefit patients. I’m thankful to Marc and Lynne Benioff for seeing the potential of this promising field and making a generous gift to inspire other philanthropists, to the deans of the Schools of Medicine and Engineering for their leadership in developing this new initiative, and to Mark and Debra Leslie for joining the Benioffs with their generous support.” The Benioffs announced their lead gift to Stanford along with funding for the University of California, San Francisco to create the UCSF Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, which aims to radically rethink the role of the microbiome in early life and develop new interventions to prevent childhood diseases. These gifts further energize the Bay Area’s thriving microbiome research community and leverage the collaborative research in this realm already taking place at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a research institute affiliated with Stanford, UCSF and UC Berkeley. “Lynne and I are honored to support the cutting-edge research of two of the world’s leading universities as they pioneer a new era of microbiome research, science and therapies,” Marc Benioff said. “With a deeper understanding of the human microbiome, our generation can unlock new treatments that impact lives around the world.” Collaborative team MITI is led by Michael Fischbach, associate professor of bioengineering. MITI leverages Stanford’s extensive expertise in microbiome research, the strengths and proximity of Stanford’s Schools of Medicine and Engineering and the interdisciplinary endeavors of Stanford ChEM-H (Chemistry, Engineering and Medicine for Human Health).   Q&A:Michael Fischbach wants to build a microbiome from the ground up. So what do we need to get there? Fischbach explains why the microbiome is worth studying, what his lab is doing to understand the complex communities, and how the people and mission of ChEM-H drew him to Stanford. Read more  Fischbach, who is also the Stanford MAC3 Paul and Mildred Berg Faculty Scholar and the Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Faculty Scholar in the School of Engineering, was recruited to Stanford in 2017 through a collaboration between Stanford ChEM-H and the Department of Bioengineering. He brought together a small group of Stanford faculty who were already working to better understand the microbiome. Fischbach proposed forming MITI (pronounced “mighty”) to focus that group’s efforts on manipulating microbial communities – both their composition and their genetics – and engineering those communities into therapies to address a range of diseases. “This initiative is a perfect reflection of the ChEM-H vision of bringing together chemistry, engineering and medicine to revolutionize therapeutic development and to improve human health,” said Carolyn Bertozzi, professor of chemistry and the Baker Family Co-Director of Stanford ChEM-H. “Since its inception, ChEM-H has had a strong interest in microbiome science and medicine and we were thrilled to succeed, in partnership with the Department of Bioengineering, in recruiting Michael Fischbach to ChEM-H to lead a targeted, pioneering initiative in this area.” Bertozzi is also Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. The initiative draws on a culture at Stanford of working across disciplines to tackle major issues with imaginative solutions, said Kathryn Moler, vice provost and dean of research and the Sapp Family University Fellow in Undergraduate Education. “This initiative couldn’t happen without the involvement and support of the deans of the schools of Medicine and Engineering and a willingness of faculty across campus to step outside their traditional domains and creatively work together to accelerate actionable discoveries and make a tangible impact in human health,” she said. “The team has an ambitious goal and I’m thankful ChEM-H is able to provide a natural home for this initiative to flourish.” Initial funding       Science & Technology Exploring the microbiome frontier This collection of stories about scientists at Stanford reveals the many ways they are learning how the microbiome influences health and how to harness the microbiome to treat disease and improve our overall well-being.    The lead gift from Marc and Lynne Benioff, and the funds provided by Mark and Debra Leslie, will enable the Stanford MITI team to initiate the work needed to construct, manipulate and characterize novel microbial therapies for a range of human diseases. Stanford will seek additional philanthropic support in order to bring promising new therapies to early-stage human clinical trials. Marc Benioff is the chairman, co-chief executive officer and founder of Salesforce. Lynne Benioff is a Distinguished Director of the Board of Overseers of the University of California San Francisco Foundation and serves on the board of directors of the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals, along with several other organizations. Mark Leslie is founder and managing general partner at Leslie Ventures, a private investment company, and a lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Debra Leslie is a director of the Leslie Family Foundation, whose mission is to positively impact lives through economic development, health care and education, and to support Jewish community life. Focus on therapies   MITI leadership Executive Committee: Carolyn Bertozzi, professor of chemistry; Michael Fischbach, associate professor of bioengineering; Justin Sonnenburg, professor of microbiology & immunology Advisory Committee: Jennifer Doudna, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, UC Berkeley; Steve Quake, professor of bioengineering and applied physics; Christopher Walsh, emeritus professor, Harvard Medical School Core members: Ami Bhatt, assistant professor of medicine and genetics; Dylan Dodd, assistant professor of pathology and microbiology & immunology; Michael Fischbach, associate professor of bioengineering; KC Huang, professor of bioengineering and microbiology & immunology; David Relman, professor of medicine and microbiology & immunology; Elizabeth Sattely, associate professor of chemical engineering; Justin Sonnenburg, professor of microbiology & immunology  Much of the microbiome research currently underway focuses on sequencing and cataloging communities of microbes in our gut and on our skin – work that has led to discoveries about the role of the microbiome in diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, autoimmune disease and cancer. Fischbach said little has been done until now to precisely manipulate those communities or their genomes to explore possibilities for new treatments. Instead, current therapy utilizes human stool: an undefined community of microbes with unknown modes of action and variable therapeutic outcomes. “This groundbreaking research at the intersection of engineering and medicine is precisely what we envisioned when we joined forces with Stanford ChEM-H to recruit Michael Fischbach,” said Jennifer Cochran, who is the Shriram Chair of the Department of Bioengineering. “Achieving this ambitious goal will draw on Stanford’s expertise in engineering novel solutions and experience translating research into new therapies to be tested in humans. I appreciate the support of the schools of Medicine and Engineering and Stanford ChEM-H for their valuable teamwork in forming this new initiative.” The initiative will launch with seven faculty from across engineering and medicine, plus executive and advisory committees to provide expert guidance and is based in part on pioneering work from Alice Cheng, a clinical instructor in gastroenterology at Stanford Medicine.

Stanford,Race influences professional investors’ judgments,Social Sciences,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/12/race-influences-professional-investors-judgments/,"   When a black-led venture capital firm has an impressive track record, it encounters more bias from professional investors, according to new research by Stanford scholars.  Psychology Professor Jennifer Eberhardt is lead author of a new study on how race influences professional investors’ judgments. (Image credit: Nana Kofi Nti)  In a new study led by Stanford psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt, in collaboration with the private investment firm Illumen Capital, researchers found that when venture capital funds are managed by a person of color with strong credentials, professional investors judge them more harshly than their white counterparts with identical credentials. These findings, set to be published Aug. 12 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that funds led by people of color might paradoxically encounter more obstacles after they have proved themselves to be strong performers, said Eberhardt, who is the Morris M. Doyle Centennial Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. “It’s not simply a pipeline problem,” Eberhardt said. “African Americans who are most qualified, those with the best track record, are getting blocked the most.” Co-authors on the paper include Hazel Rose Markus, the Davis-Brack Professor in the Behavioral Sciences; Sarah Lyons-Padilla, a research scientist at SPARQ, a program in the Psychology Department at the School of Humanities and Sciences co-directed by Eberhardt and Markus; and Ashby Monk, executive director of the Stanford Global Projects Center. Examining disparities in investment Professional investors – people who manage money for governments, nonprofits and companies – do not appear to be hiring or investing in professional fund managers with diverse backgrounds, the researchers said, noting previous research that found that fewer than 1.3 percent of the $69.1 trillion in global assets under the four major asset classes – mutual funds, hedge funds, real estate and private equity – are managed by women and people of color. “Given the power and influence of asset allocators – professional investors – it is critical to understand how they deploy capital and make investment decisions,” Monk said. “In today’s market, investments flow through professional money managers before taking root in companies and projects. As such, if asset allocators set incorrect or biased incentives, the entire capitalist system will reflect and reinforce these biases.” To identify any potential racial bias beyond a potential pipeline problem, the researchers asked 180 asset allocators to evaluate four venture capital funds that were led by either black or white men. The professional investors were presented with four one-page summaries of the funds’ credentials and performance history. There were two versions with a black male managing partner leading either a stronger or a weaker team, and two versions with a white male managing partner leading either a stronger or a weaker team. The researchers then asked the investors to rate each firm’s overall performance, investment skills, competency, social fit and their expectations of how much the fund could raise. They also asked the investors how likely they were to take a meeting with the team and begin the investment process. How do investors judge venture capital funds? The researchers found that professional investors rated the stronger white-male-led team marginally higher than the stronger-quality black-male-led team. But when a firm’s credentials were weaker, investors favored the black-led, racially diverse team. However, the professional investors expressed that they were not likely to invest in either of the weaker teams, diverse or otherwise, the researchers said. Another finding to emerge was a disparity between how professional investors judged stronger and the weaker teams. The researchers found that when investors evaluated the white-led teams, they could easily distinguish between the stronger and weaker firms – they assigned the stronger team higher ratings and the weaker team lower ratings. However, this did not hold up for professional investors’ assessments of either of the black-led teams. When investors were asked to rate the black-led teams, they were unable to distinguish between the stronger and weaker black-led teams. “Over 98 percent of the industry is white and male,” Eberhardt said. “One explanation of this finding could be that investors have rarely seen black-led teams. They simply don’t know how to evaluate them.” Taken together, these findings suggest how black-led teams are likely to encounter more bias when their credentials are stronger, the researchers said. The results also suggest that racial disparities in investing are not only a pipeline problem. “While it is important to work on populating the pipeline, we need to think about how to continue supporting diverse teams who have already established themselves as strong performers,” Lyons-Padilla said. “Our results suggest these teams may not receive as much consideration as their white-male-led counterparts.” Leaving money on the table By undervaluing high-performing funds led by people of color or by overvaluing white-male-led funds, investors may not realize they are missing opportunities for higher financial returns, the researchers said. “In fact, asset allocators might be violating their fiduciary obligations (i.e., to generate the highest possible returns for their investors) by not investing in funds led by people of color that could produce returns as high or higher than white-male-led funds,” the researchers write. “Investors should be knowledgeable about successful firms led by people of color,” Markus said. “They can counter their biases by developing specific investment criteria and establishing a transparent process for making decisions.” Other authors on the paper include Radhika Shah, co-president at Stanford Angels & Entrepreneurs. Sid Radhakrishna and Norris A. “Daryn” Dodson IV of Illumen Capital are also co-authors. SPARQ collaborated with Illumen Capital to examine the sources and consequences of gender and racial disparities in investing.

Stanford,Gauging trees’ potential to slow global warming,Science & Technology,2019-08-18,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/12/gauging-trees-potential-slow-global-warming/,"   Like the eponymous character in Shel Silverstein’s classic children’s tale, trees are generous with their gifts, cleaning the air we breathe and slowing the ravages of global warming by absorbing about a quarter of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. But this generosity likely can’t last forever in the face of unabated fossil fuel consumption and deforestation. Scientists have long wondered whether trees and plants could reach a breaking point and no longer adequately absorb carbon dioxide.  Trees such as these in Sequoia National Park will continue to absorb carbon dioxide at generous rates through at least the end of the century, a new study finds.

However, the study published Aug. 12 in Nature Climate Change warns that trees can only absorb a fraction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and their ability to do so beyond 2100 is unclear. “Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is the best way to limit further warming,” said study lead author César Terrer, a postdoctoral scholar in Earth system science in Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. “But stopping deforestation and preserving forests so they can grow more is our next-best solution.” Weighing carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide – the dominant greenhouse gas warming the earth – is food for trees and plants. Combined with nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, it helps trees grow and thrive. But as carbon dioxide concentrations rise, trees will need extra nitrogen and phosphorus to balance their diet. The question of how much extra carbon dioxide trees can take up, given limitations of these other nutrients, is a critical uncertainty in predicting global warming.

We need to know how high the interest rate will be on our carbon investment.” Several individual experiments, such as fumigating forests with elevated levels of carbon dioxide and growing plants in gas-filled chambers, have provided critical data but no definitive answer globally. To more accurately predict the capacity of trees and plants to sequester carbon dioxide in the future, the researchers synthesized data from all elevated carbon dioxide experiments conducted so far – in grassland, shrubland, cropland and forest systems – including ones the researchers directed. Using statistical methods, machine-learning, models and satellite data, they quantified how much soil nutrients and climate factors limit the ability of plants and trees to absorb extra carbon dioxide. Based on global datasets of soil nutrients, they also mapped the potential of carbon dioxide to increase the amount and size of plants in the future, when atmospheric concentrations of the gas could double. Their results show that carbon dioxide levels expected by the end of the century should increase plant biomass by 12 percent, enabling plants and trees to store more carbon dioxide – an amount equivalent to six years of current fossil fuel emissions. The study highlights important partnerships trees forge with soil microbes and fungi to help them take up the extra nitrogen and phosphorus they need to balance their additional carbon dioxide intake. It also emphasizes the critical role of tropical forests, such as those in the Amazon, Congo and Indonesia, as regions with the greatest potential to store additional carbon. “We have already witnessed indiscriminate logging in pristine tropical forests, which are the largest reservoirs of biomass in the planet,” said Terrer, who also has a secondary affiliation with the Institut de Ciència i Tecnologia Ambientals, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. “We stand to lose a tremendously important tool to limit global warming.” To read all stories about Stanford science, subscribe to the biweekly Stanford Science Digest.

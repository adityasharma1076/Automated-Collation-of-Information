Science Daily,New Cyclization Reactions for Synthesizing Macrocyclic Drug Leads,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142721.htm,"   In fact, macrocycles show a great ability to bind difficult targets that have flat, featureless surfaces. This has raised tremendous interest in the pharmaceutical industry, which is particularly interested in macrocyclic compounds with a molecular weight below 1 KDa, which would be small enough to cross the cell membrane and reach intracellular disease targets, e.g. proteins or even genes in the cell. Still, there is a hurdle: there aren't enough suitable macrocycle libraries or methods to generate such small macrocycles. The compound libraries that pharmaceutical companies use today in high-throughput screens do contain 1-2 million different molecules, but those are mostly classical small molecules and only a handful are actual macrocyclics -- at most, only a few hundred. This is too small a number for the screens to yield good hits when searching for possible drug candidates against challenging disease targets. Now, scientists at EPFL have found a way to generate libraries of more than 9,000 of macrocyclic molecules below 1 KDa, all with high structural diversity. ""Initially, what we wanted to do is generate orally available or cell-permeable macrocyclic drugs,"" says Professor Christian Heinis, whose lab led the study. The libraries were generated by ""cyclizing"" short linear peptides in combination with diverse linker reagents, which promote chemical bonding. The yields of the macrocyclization reactions turned out to be so efficient that there was no need for purification. And in a key breakthrough, the new method also led to the discovery of surprisingly efficient macrocyclization reactions based on the ligation of thiol and amino groups of short peptides. The work was supported by EPFL's Biomolecular Screening Facility (BSF), headed by Gerardo Turcatti. ""EPFL has already developed the liquid handling processes to perform the combinatorial synthesis and to screen the macrocyclic compound libraries,"" he says. Screening identified binders of different disease targets, including inhibitors of thrombin, an important target of coagulation disorders. X-ray structure analysis of a thrombin inhibitor by partners in Italy showed a snug fit of the macrocycle to its target. Heinis's lab is now further developing the macrocycle synthesis approach in order to screen even larger combinatorial libraries. Working closely with the BSF with the support of NCCR Chemical Biology, the next step is to generate macrocyclic inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions, for which we currently have no good inhibitors.

Science Daily,Can Pomegranate Juice Protect the Infant Brain?,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142719.htm,"   ""Our study provides preliminary evidence suggesting potential protective effects for newborns exposed to pomegranate juice while in utero,"" said senior author Terrie Inder, MBCHB, chair of the Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine at the Brigham. ""These findings warrant continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols in at-risk newborns, such as those with hypoxic-ischemic injury."" In cases of IUGR, a baby in the womb is measuring small for its gestational age, often because of issues with the placenta, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. One out of every 10 babies is considered to have IUGR. The process of birth itself can further decrease blood flow or oxygen to the baby, including to the baby's brain. If this is very severe, it can result in a condition known as hypoxic-ischemic injury, which contributes to almost one-quarter of newborn deaths worldwide. Polyphenols, which include tannic acid and ellagitannins, are part of a class of antioxidants found in many foods and beverages, including nuts, berries, red wine and teas. Pomegranate juice is a particularly rich source of these molecules. Polyphenols are known to cross the blood-brain barrier, and studies in animal models have demonstrated protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. To date, no clinical studies had evaluated the potential effects of giving pregnant women pomegranate juice to protect the brains of at-risk newborns. The current randomized, controlled, double-blinded study enrolled 78 mothers from Barnes-Jewish Hospital obstetric clinic in St. Louis with IUGR diagnosed at 24-43 weeks' gestation. Women were randomized to receive 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily or a taste/calorie matched placebo that was polyphenol free. Women drank the juice daily from enrollment until delivery. The team measured several aspects of brain development and injury, including infant brain macrostructure, microstructural organization and functional connectivity. While the team did not observe differences in brain macrostructure, they did find regional differences in white matter microstructure and functional connectivity. ""These measures tell us about how the brain is developing functionally,"" said Inder. ""We saw no difference in brain growth and baby growth, but we did see improvement in cabling network and brain development measured by synchronous blood flow and visual development of the brain."" The authors note that the findings warrant the need for a larger, rigorously designed clinical trial to allow continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols. Such a study is now underway at the Brigham. ""We plan to continue investigating these exciting findings,"" said Inder. ""While the preliminary evidence shows promise, additional study and replication is needed."" "
Science Daily,Parasite Needs Chemical (Lipid/nutrient) in Cat Intestines for Sex,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821173713.htm,"   Toxoplasma can live asexually in any mammal, including humans. But it forms gametes (sexual cells) only in cats, a restriction that has long been recognized, but whose reason was not understood. The authors suspected something was missing when reproducing the infections in vitro and not observing sexual development. It is known that fungi require linoleic acid for sexual development. To test Toxoplasma's requirement for the same lipid, they generated cat intestinal organoids -- three-dimensional ""test tube"" models that share several essential properties with actual intestines -- and showed that linoleic acid was required for sexual reproduction of the parasite. Cats lack an enzyme called delta-6-desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, accounting for the peculiarly high levels of linoleic acid in the cat intestine, but not in other mammals. When the authors supplemented the diet of mice with linoleic acid, and added a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, Toxoplasma could complete the sexual phase of its life cycle in the mouse intestine. Toxoplasma is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the US, according to CDC. The most common route of infection for human is by consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked meat. Cat litter, after 24-48 of being cleaned, can also a source of Toxoplasma infection. However, cats can only shed oocysts once in their life time. Pregnant women are urged to avoid eating raw or undercooked meat, as also avoiding cleaning the litterbox after 48 hours, to prevent Toxoplasma infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis can have potentially serious consequences for the unborn child. An improved understanding of the parasite life cycle stemming from this study may lead to production of vaccines that could inhibit Toxoplasma's sexual reproduction or the transmission of Toxoplasma to livestock.

Science Daily,New Pharmaceutical Target Reverses Osteoporosis in Mice,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821173709.htm,"   ""The most widely used drugs currently approved by the FDA to treat osteoporosis can prevent further bone loss, but they don't help rebuild the bone,"" said Shyni Varghese, professor of biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering and materials science, and orthopedics at Duke. ""We've discovered a biochemical receptor that, when activated, can do both,"" added Yu-Ru ""Vernon"" Shih, a research scientist in Varghese's lab and the study's first author. The findings appear online August 21 in the journal Science Advances. Despite its apparent rigidity, bone is living tissue constantly being broken down and replaced by the body. Osteoporosis occurs when old tissue is lost faster than new tissue can be created, causing the bone to become weak and brittle. The disease afflicts more than 40 million men and women in the United States alone and is most common in older women past menopause. In 2014, Varghese was studying the role of popular biomedical devices made of calcium phosphate in promoting bone repair and regeneration. She discovered that the biochemical adenosine acting on the A2B receptor plays a particularly large role in promoting bone growth. It stood to reason that a lack of the chemical might play a role in the development of osteoporosis, so Varghese decided to find out. In the study, Varghese and her research team studied mice that had had their ovaries removed to mimic post-menopause osteoporosis. They looked at the expression levels of two enzymes that help produce adenosine as well as the levels of adenosine traveling between cells. As predicted, they discovered that the mice's lack of estrogen was causing all three to plummet. The researchers then tested to see if increasing the levels of adenosine in the mice would help reverse the damaging effects of the disease. But rather than pumping in adenosine itself, they injected a non-hormonal small molecule produced by Bayer that activates the A2B receptor. ""The mice that received the drug were completely cured,"" said Varghese. ""Their bones were just as healthy as the control group without osteoporosis."" While the discovery of a pharmaceutical target capable of reversing osteoporosis is exciting, creating a small molecule drug that can activate it without side effects is a difficult task. Adenosine is created naturally throughout the entire body and has many roles such as modulating neurons and regulating blood flow to various organs. Researchers can't simply dump a bunch of it into the bloodstream to stop bone degradation without side effects. But with the A2B receptor identified, Varghese and others can start looking for ways to deliver activators to bones without flooding other areas of the body. For example, one of Varghese's students is beginning to study ways of tethering adenosine-like molecules to carriers that target bone tissue. Her lab is also pursuing a sort of bandage that can deliver growth-supporting drugs directly to damaged or broken bones. This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01-AR063184, R01-AR071552). "
Science Daily,Health Records Pin Broad Set of Health Risks on Genetic Premutation,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163824.htm,"   In recent years, however, at least two clinical conditions have been well documented in the carriers themselves: an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder and, in female carriers, early menopause. Now, a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Marshfield Clinic has found that there may be a much broader health risk to carriers, with potentially dozens of clinical conditions that can be ascribed directly to carrying the premutation. The researchers employed machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to mine decades of electronic health records of nearly 20,000 individuals. In a study published Aug. 21 in Science Advances, a team led by Marsha Mailick, a researcher and professor at UW-Madison's Waisman Center, and UW-Madison graduate student Arezoo Movaghar provide a better understanding of the previously disputed relationship between this well-known genetic premutation and a wide range of clinical conditions. At the same time, the interdisciplinary study richly illustrates the power of data-driven discovery. In the study, carriers were found to experience a much higher prevalence and severity of such conditions as depression, anxiety, mood disorders, sleep apnea, respiratory and stomach problems, bone fractures, incontinence, and a host of other conditions. ""Our extensive phenotyping shows that premutation carriers experience a clinical profile that is significantly different from controls, and that is evident throughout adulthood,"" the study's authors write. ""The research was especially challenging as not all carriers are affected and the specific conditions each may experience varies,"" explains Mailick. ""Yet the overall pattern revealed in the electronic health record was striking."" The findings have important implications for the estimated 1 million people in the United States and many more in the rest of the world who carry premutations of the FMR1 gene. People are generally unaware they carry the altered gene unless a family member is found to have fragile X syndrome, which is rare. The new study depended on the electronic health records of 19,996 adults collected over 40 years from Marshfield Clinic, a health system in central Wisconsin that was among the first in the nation to adopt electronic record keeping. In addition to their extensive, searchable medical histories, study subjects also contributed their DNA through the clinic's Personalized Medicine Research Project, enabling the study's authors to identify 98 patients who carry the FMR1 premutation. A primary goal of the new study, according to Mailick, was to use electronic health records to set up a double-blind methodology -- where both clinicians and patients were blind to genotype -- to assess whether premutation carriers differed in their patterns of clinical diagnoses from those lacking the premutation. The question is an important one as some clinical reports have suggested that premutation carriers were at greater risk for a wide range of health conditions, including autoimmune diseases, migraines, neuropathy, depression, infertility, fibromyalgia, anxiety and cognitive deficits, all with varying frequencies and emerging at different stages of life. Such correlations, notes Mailick, are the stuff of biomedical controversy as nearly all of the studies associating those conditions with the premutation were the result of a family member being diagnosed with fragile X. Following diagnosis of fragile X, family members are offered genetic testing leading to the identification of relatives who carry the premutation. Awareness of that genetic status by patients and clinicians can confound prevalence estimates of symptoms. Frequently, carriers' medical conditions are blamed on the stress of care giving and having a family member with fragile X syndrome. ""This is a controversy,"" says Mailick, who has spent a career studying the life course trajectories of people with developmental disabilities as well as their families through UW-Madison's Waisman Center. ""There wasn't unbiased data available before this study to inform the controversy. This study does so in a powerful way. The data validate the clinical experience."" By scouring the medical histories of patients with the premutation, the Wisconsin researchers identified an astonishing range of health conditions and symptoms affecting FMR1 carriers later in life. For women, these include agoraphobia, social phobia, panic disorders, infertility, menstrual disorders, and falls and fractures, among others. For men, clinical diagnoses commonly found in health records of FMR1 carriers include depression, diseases of the respiratory system, and urinary incontinence, as well as half a dozen other afflictions. Movaghar and Mailick say some of the conditions associated with FMR1 carriers have long been suspected, but the number and range of health effects they found was a surprise: ""We see conditions nobody ever associated with the premutation,"" Movaghar says. To be included in the study data, subjects had to experience the diagnosis in at least two separate visits, helping weed out misdiagnoses or recording errors. The approach used in this study, the Wisconsin researchers say, could also be applied to other genetic variants similarly believed to be innocuous but that potentially may have health effects. "
Science Daily,Most Patients Willing to Share Medical Records for Research Purposes,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163816.htm,"   But the looming, lingering question is to what degree are individual patients willing to share medical records and biospecimens with researchers and institutions beyond their personal physician or health care system? And more specifically, how should patients be asked and what information are they most likely to share? In a novel attempt to answer these questions, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, with collaborators in California, North Carolina and Texas, asked patients at two academic hospitals to respond to a variety of different approaches seeking to share their medical data with other researchers. The findings are published in the August 21, 2019 online issue of JAMA Network Open. The survey was conducted at two academic hospitals -- UC San Diego Health and UC Irvine Health between May 1, 2017 and September 31, 2018. Participants were randomly selected to one of four options with different layouts and formats for indicating sharing preferences: opt-in simple, opt-in detailed, opt-out simple and opt-out detailed. In the simple forms, there were 18 categories where participants could choose to share information; in the detailed forms, there were 59 items. The items ranged from demographics like age, sex and race and socioeconomic status to lab results (genetic tests, drug screening, etc.), imaging (x-rays, MRI) and biospecimens (blood, urine, tissue). Participants were also asked to what degree they would be willing to share their medical data: with researchers only in the same health care organization or with those working at other nonprofit or for-profit institutions. Among 1,800 eligible participants, 1,246 completed the data sharing survey and were included in the analysis and 850 responded to a satisfaction survey. Slightly less than 60 percent were female and slightly less than 80 percent were white. The mean age was 51 years old. More than 67 percent of survey participants indicated they would share all items with researchers from the home institution (which patients presumably already trust with their health care), with progressively smaller percentages for sharing with other nonprofit institutions or with other for-profit institutions. Many of the respondents indicated that they were only unwilling to share a few items. ""These results are important because data from a single institution is often insufficient to achieve statistical significance in research findings,"" said the study's senior author, Lucila Ohno-Machado, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, associate dean for informatics and technology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine and chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at UC San Diego Health. ""When sample sizes are small, it is unclear whether the research findings generalize to a larger population. Additionally, in alignment with the concept of personalized medicine, it is important to see whether it is possible to personalize privacy settings for sharing clinical data."" Generally speaking, the current state of affairs concerning the sharing of ""anonymized"" patient health data for secondary research is uneven and unsettled. It has been shown that anonymization methods -- in which data sets are either encrypted or stripped of personally identifiable information -- are not 100 percent effective. Since 2013, newly enrolled patients are required to proactively consent to sharing their personal health information for research studies or future secondary use. In California, a patient's specific permission is required to share mental health, substance abuse, HIV status and genetic information, but other items or conditions are not specified. In many states, there is no requirement for a patient's specific permission on these types of items before they can be shared. Today, for practical purposes, patients have the option to decline any part of their medical record be used for research. They cannot indicate what types of research or researcher should be able to obtain their records. Almost three-quarters of respondents -- 67.1 percent -- said they would be willing to share all items with researchers from their health care institutions; almost one-quarter said they would be willing to share all items with all interested researchers, a finding the authors said was reassuring and could help in the planning of studies based on EHRs and biospecimens that would be expected to be broadly shared. Equally encouraging: Less than 4 percent of participants said they were not willing to share any information with anyone. Ohno-Machado said the way in which preferences are elicited also has an influence. There was greater sharing per item when respondents were asked to opt-out than when they were asked to opt-in. Whether the form had details about the items or used broad categories did not have an influence on sharing. ""This is important because a simple form could be used in the future to elicit choices from all patients, saving their time without significantly affecting their privacy preferences,"" said Ohno-Machado. ""However, different rates of sharing are expected for opt-in and opt-out of sharing clinical records for research."" A key finding was that a majority of survey participants identified at least one item that they did not want to share with a particular type of researcher (for example, a scientist at another for-profit institution), though they were willing to share other items. ""This finding is important,"" wrote the authors, ""because the item to withhold may not be of relevance to a certain study, but the current all-or-nothing option, if chosen, would remove that patient's data from all research studies."" The authors said the survey's tiered-permission system that allows specific removal of data items or categories proves both doable and appealing to patients, in part because there are differences among individuals in where and with whom they share what. The findings, said the authors, trigger further questions about the ideal balance between giving patients the ability to choose what portions of their data they want to share for research and with whom and the ""greater good,"" i.e., how fast research can be accelerated for the benefit of all. ""Institutions currently make decisions on sharing on behalf of all patients who do not explicitly decline sharing. It is possible that asking patients directly would increase the amount of data shared for research. On the other hand, it is also possible that some types of research would suffer from small sample sizes if patients consistently decline certain categories of items,"" Ohno-Machado said. "
Science Daily,New Pathway for Potential Glioblastoma Treatment,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163812.htm,"   The Texas A&M team's research focuses on the AH receptor, which controls expression of a diverse set of genes, essentially contradicts what was previously understood in glioblastoma research. The Texas A&M study was published in July in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. ""We found the AH receptor -- which was previously reported in the literature to be a pro-invasion gene -- actually blocked invasion of glioblastoma cells,"" said Safe, who is a Distinguished Professor of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology (VTPP) in the CVM. ""When we add certain AH receptor ligands (molecules that bonds to another molecule), we observed a potent inhibition of glioblastoma cell invasion. Basically, we've shown that it's a good gene that can be targeted by drugs to make it even more effective."" Glioblastomas, the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults, are comprised of tumor cells that rapidly reproduce and divide, which allow the tumor to grow into nearby normal brain tissue. Currently, these brain tumors are incurable -- a patient's median life expectancy after diagnosis is 11-15 months with standard treatments. According to the American Brain Tumor Association, glioblastomas also form new blood vessels so they can maintain their rapid growth and may use connection fibers to spread to the opposite side of the brain. Safe said that the tumors are difficult to treat. Because glioblastomas often have finger-like tentacles that spread through the brain, they may not be completely removed through surgery. The tumor's individual cells also respond differently to various therapies. The Texas A&M study used patient glioblastoma cells in collaboration with colleagues at the Detroit Medical Center, as well as cells that were used in previously published glioblastoma studies. The researchers analyzed the AH receptor and several receptor ligands, including Kynurenine. Previous published studies in the journal Nature found that the AH receptor and Kynurenine were involved in glioblastoma cells' invasion of the brain. However, the Texas A&M researchers refuted these findings by showing that AH receptors actually serve a protective function and do not promote the invasion of glioblastoma cells. In addition, when researchers added AH receptor ligands but Kynurenine was not active, the level of protection to the brain was enhanced. These findings suggest that the AH receptor could be a target for the development of drugs to inhibit glioblastoma. The Texas A&M team is now studying the use of the AH receptor as a target for inhibiting glioblastoma and identifying compounds that bind to the AH receptor to provide additional protection to the brain. ""This study opens up a new way for developing potential clinical applications,"" Safe said. ""Whether this line of inquiry will be successful remains to be seen, but our work may offer hope for a disease which has such a poor prognosis."" "
Science Daily,Lower Back Pain? Self-Administered Acupressure Could Help,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163805.htm,"   ""Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, but instead of needles, pressure is applied with a finger, thumb or device to specific points on the body,"" says Susan Murphy, ScD, OTR, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Michigan Medicine and lead author of the study. Murphy says that while acupressure has been previously studied -- and found to be beneficial -- in people with cancer-related or osteoarthritis pain, there are few studies that have examined acupressure in people with back pain. In the study, published in Pain Medicine, the research team randomly assigned 67 participants with chronic low back pain into three groups: relaxing acupressure, stimulating acupressure or usual care. ""Relaxing acupressure is thought to be effective in reducing insomnia, while stimulating acupressure is thought to be effective in fatigue reduction,"" Murphy says. Participants in the acupressure groups were trained to administer acupressure on certain points of the body, and spent between 27 and 30 minutes daily, over the course of six weeks, performing the technique. Participants in the usual care group were asked to continue whatever treatments they were currently receiving from their care providers to manage their back pain and fatigue. ""Compared to the usual care group, we found that people who performed stimulating acupressure experienced pain and fatigue improvement and those that performed relaxing acupressure felt their pain had improved after six weeks,"" Murphy says. ""We found no differences among the groups in terms of sleep quality or disability after the six weeks."" Potential treatment option Murphy notes that chronic pain is difficult to manage and people with the condition tend to have additional symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and depression. ""Better treatments are needed for chronic pain,"" Murphy says. ""Most treatments offered are medications, which have side effects, and in some cases, may increase the risk of abuse and addiction."" She says this study highlights the benefits of a non-pharmacological treatment option that patients could perform easily on their own and see positive results. ""Although larger studies are needed, acupressure may be a useful pain management strategy given that it is low risk, low cost and easy to administer,"" Murphy says. ""We also recommend additional studies into the different types of acupressure and how they could more specifically be targeted to patients based on their symptoms."" "
Science Daily,Scientists Discover the Basics of How Pressure-Sensing Piezo Proteins Work,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163637.htm,"   In the study, published Aug. 21 in Nature, the scientists used advanced microscopy techniques to image the Piezo1 protein at rest and during the application of mechanical forces. They confirmed this complex protein's structure and showed essentially how it can convert mechanical stimuli into an electrical signal. ""Our analysis shows that tension on the cell membrane in which Piezo1 is embedded can flatten and widen the protein's structure,"" said co-senior author Dr. Simon Scheuring, a professor of physiology and biophysics in anesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Scheuring and his laboratory collaborated on the study with the laboratory of Dr. Roderick MacKinnon, a professor of molecular neurobiology and biophysics at The Rockefeller University. Dr. MacKinnon was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003 for his work determining the structures and mechanisms of ion channel proteins. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are very large and complex proteins with unique structures. They are embedded within the membranes of certain cell types, and their function is to transduce mechanical force on cells into electrical signals that alter cell activity. Piezo1 proteins work for example in bladder cells to detect when the bladder is full, and in blood vessel-lining cells to detect and help regulate changes in blood pressure. Piezo2 proteins work in sensory nerve endings in the skin and joints, helping to mediate the senses of touch, pain, and proprioception -- the sense of how one's limbs are arranged. Advances in imaging techniques have enabled scientists in recent years to determine the basic structure of Piezo1 -- a structure that Piezo2 is thought to mostly share. From above this structure has a three-armed, propeller or ""triskelion"" appearance. From the side it looks like a shallow bowl embedded in the cell membrane, with an ion channel at its center. The latter, when opened, allows a flow of calcium and other positively charged ions into the cell. The basic mechanism by which mechanical force opens the ion channel has remained mysterious. But in the new study Dr. Scheuring and Dr. MacKinnon and their colleagues, including lead author Dr. Yi-Chih Lin, a postdoctoral associate in anesthesiology, were able to get a clearer picture of how it works. They combined cryo-electron microscopy with a less well-known technique called high-speed atomic force microscopy, which produces an image of an object essentially by feeling its surface with a super-sensitive mechanical probe. They showed with these methods that Piezo1 is a springy structure that normally bends the cell membrane where it sits, but will flatten out when, for example, a mechanical force is applied to the cell membrane. ""As the membrane tension increases, the structure of Piezo1 flattens and stretches out to occupy a larger area, which in turn opens the ion channel,"" Dr. Scheuring said. He noted the possibility that other stimuli that stretch and flatten the Piezo1 structure, such as a pulling force on its arms from the inside or on an external domain called the CED from the outside the cell, in principle could open the ion channel -- making it a suitably versatile mechanism for the wide range of cell types and physiological functions in which it works. Moreover, given this wide range of cell types -- in organs including the lungs, bladder, intestines, and pancreas, as well as in blood vessels and the sensory nervous system -- the discovery of the basic Piezo-protein mechanism could lead to new ways of understanding and treating many human diseases. To take one example, Dr. Scheuring said, if the membranes of cells lining blood vessels contain excess cholesterol they would become stiffer, increasing the background tension on embedded Piezo 1 proteins and potentially disrupting these proteins' normal ability to detect and help regulate blood pressure. ""Our finding leads to a great many predictions about Piezo proteins' roles in disease that we and others can now go and investigate,"" he said. "
Science Daily,Meaningful PTSD Symptom Decrease May Lower Type 2 Diabetes Risk,Health & Medicine,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142734.htm,"   The study, ""Clinically Meaningful PTSD Improvement and Risk for Type 2 Diabetes,"" by Jeffrey Scherrer, Ph.D., professor in Family and Community Medicine at SLU, was published online Aug. 21 in JAMA Psychiatry. ""Some long-term chronic health conditions associated with PTSD may be less likely to occur among patients who experience clinically meaningful symptom reduction either through treatment or spontaneous improvement,"" Scherrer said. PTSD affects up to 12 percent of civilians and nearly 30 percent of the veteran population. Those with PTSD are at risk for other health issues and improvement in PTSD symptoms is associated with parallel improvements in depression, emotional well-being, sleep, blood pressure and general physical health. PTSD is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which may be explained by the high prevalence of obesity, glucose dysregulation, inflammation, metabolic syndrome and depression among those diagnosed with PTSD versus those without PTSD. This retrospective cohort study reviewed Veterans Health Affairs medical record data from 2008 to 2015. The researchers randomly selected 5,916 cases from among a veteran patient population aged 18 to 70 who had more than two visits to PTSD specialty care between 2008 and 2012. The patients were followed through until 2015. After applying eligibility criteria, 1,598 patients with PTSD and free of diabetes risk were available for analysis. Clinically meaningful symptom reduction is a decrease of 20 points on the PTSD Checklist score. The research found the results were independent of numerous demographic, psychiatric and physical comorbidities. The sample was 84.3 percent male, 66 percent Caucasian and 22 percent African-American. The mean age of the patients was 42. The association was also independent of the number of PTSD psychotherapy sessions used. ""In patients with only PTSD, clinically meaningful PCL decrease is associated with lower risk for diabetes and in patients with PTSD and depression, we found improvement in PTSD was coupled with a decrease in depression,"" Scherrer said. ""Thus decreased risk for type 2 diabetes appears to follow large PTSD symptom decrease and in patients with both PTSD and depression, improvement in both conditions may be necessary to reduce risk for type 2 diabetes."" ""Surprisingly, clinically meaningful PTSD improvement was not associated with a change in BMI and A1C values."" A prospective study is needed to advance research, Scherrer says, due in part to the limitations of medical record data. Such a study could determine if large decreases in PTSD checklist scores are associated with improved insulin resistance and reduced inflammation. Take-aways The observational study examined whether veterans who experienced a greater reduction in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had an associated lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The analysis included medical records from almost 1,600 veterans who received PTSD specialty care and had repeated completion of the PTSD Checklist as part of their treatment at the VA. Patients with versus patients without clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptoms had a 49 percent lower risk for type 2 diabetes over a 3-6-year follow-up period. In patients with PTSD and depression, improvement in both conditions was associated with lower risk for diabetes. "

""These findings warrant continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols in at-risk newborns, such as those with hypoxic-ischemic injury."" In cases of IUGR, a baby in the womb is measuring small for its gestational age, often because of issues with the placenta, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. One out of every 10 babies is considered to have IUGR. The process of birth itself can further decrease blood flow or oxygen to the baby, including to the baby's brain. If this is very severe, it can result in a condition known as hypoxic-ischemic injury, which contributes to almost one-quarter of newborn deaths worldwide. Polyphenols, which include tannic acid and ellagitannins, are part of a class of antioxidants found in many foods and beverages, including nuts, berries, red wine and teas. Pomegranate juice is a particularly rich source of these molecules. Polyphenols are known to cross the blood-brain barrier, and studies in animal models have demonstrated protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. To date, no clinical studies had evaluated the potential effects of giving pregnant women pomegranate juice to protect the brains of at-risk newborns. The current randomized, controlled, double-blinded study enrolled 78 mothers from Barnes-Jewish Hospital obstetric clinic in St. Louis with IUGR diagnosed at 24-43 weeks' gestation. Women were randomized to receive 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily or a taste/calorie matched placebo that was polyphenol free. Women drank the juice daily from enrollment until delivery. The team measured several aspects of brain development and injury, including infant brain macrostructure, microstructural organization and functional connectivity. While the team did not observe differences in brain macrostructure, they did find regional differences in white matter microstructure and functional connectivity. ""These measures tell us about how the brain is developing functionally,"" said Inder. ""We saw no difference in brain growth and baby growth, but we did see improvement in cabling network and brain development measured by synchronous blood flow and visual development of the brain."" The authors note that the findings warrant the need for a larger, rigorously designed clinical trial to allow continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols. Such a study is now underway at the Brigham. ""We plan to continue investigating these exciting findings,"" said Inder. ""While the preliminary evidence shows promise, additional study and replication is needed."" "
Science Daily,New Pathway for Potential Glioblastoma Treatment,Mind & Brain,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163812.htm,"   The Texas A&M team's research focuses on the AH receptor, which controls expression of a diverse set of genes, essentially contradicts what was previously understood in glioblastoma research. The Texas A&M study was published in July in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. ""We found the AH receptor -- which was previously reported in the literature to be a pro-invasion gene -- actually blocked invasion of glioblastoma cells,"" said Safe, who is a Distinguished Professor of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology (VTPP) in the CVM. ""When we add certain AH receptor ligands (molecules that bonds to another molecule), we observed a potent inhibition of glioblastoma cell invasion. Basically, we've shown that it's a good gene that can be targeted by drugs to make it even more effective."" Glioblastomas, the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults, are comprised of tumor cells that rapidly reproduce and divide, which allow the tumor to grow into nearby normal brain tissue. Currently, these brain tumors are incurable -- a patient's median life expectancy after diagnosis is 11-15 months with standard treatments. According to the American Brain Tumor Association, glioblastomas also form new blood vessels so they can maintain their rapid growth and may use connection fibers to spread to the opposite side of the brain. Safe said that the tumors are difficult to treat. Because glioblastomas often have finger-like tentacles that spread through the brain, they may not be completely removed through surgery. The tumor's individual cells also respond differently to various therapies. The Texas A&M study used patient glioblastoma cells in collaboration with colleagues at the Detroit Medical Center, as well as cells that were used in previously published glioblastoma studies. The researchers analyzed the AH receptor and several receptor ligands, including Kynurenine. Previous published studies in the journal Nature found that the AH receptor and Kynurenine were involved in glioblastoma cells' invasion of the brain. However, the Texas A&M researchers refuted these findings by showing that AH receptors actually serve a protective function and do not promote the invasion of glioblastoma cells. In addition, when researchers added AH receptor ligands but Kynurenine was not active, the level of protection to the brain was enhanced. These findings suggest that the AH receptor could be a target for the development of drugs to inhibit glioblastoma. The Texas A&M team is now studying the use of the AH receptor as a target for inhibiting glioblastoma and identifying compounds that bind to the AH receptor to provide additional protection to the brain. ""This study opens up a new way for developing potential clinical applications,"" Safe said. ""Whether this line of inquiry will be successful remains to be seen, but our work may offer hope for a disease which has such a poor prognosis."" "
Science Daily,Lower Back Pain? Self-Administered Acupressure Could Help,Mind & Brain,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163805.htm,"   ""Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, but instead of needles, pressure is applied with a finger, thumb or device to specific points on the body,"" says Susan Murphy, ScD, OTR, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Michigan Medicine and lead author of the study. Murphy says that while acupressure has been previously studied -- and found to be beneficial -- in people with cancer-related or osteoarthritis pain, there are few studies that have examined acupressure in people with back pain. In the study, published in Pain Medicine, the research team randomly assigned 67 participants with chronic low back pain into three groups: relaxing acupressure, stimulating acupressure or usual care. ""Relaxing acupressure is thought to be effective in reducing insomnia, while stimulating acupressure is thought to be effective in fatigue reduction,"" Murphy says. Participants in the acupressure groups were trained to administer acupressure on certain points of the body, and spent between 27 and 30 minutes daily, over the course of six weeks, performing the technique. Participants in the usual care group were asked to continue whatever treatments they were currently receiving from their care providers to manage their back pain and fatigue. ""Compared to the usual care group, we found that people who performed stimulating acupressure experienced pain and fatigue improvement and those that performed relaxing acupressure felt their pain had improved after six weeks,"" Murphy says. ""We found no differences among the groups in terms of sleep quality or disability after the six weeks."" Potential treatment option Murphy notes that chronic pain is difficult to manage and people with the condition tend to have additional symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and depression. ""Better treatments are needed for chronic pain,"" Murphy says. ""Most treatments offered are medications, which have side effects, and in some cases, may increase the risk of abuse and addiction."" She says this study highlights the benefits of a non-pharmacological treatment option that patients could perform easily on their own and see positive results. ""Although larger studies are needed, acupressure may be a useful pain management strategy given that it is low risk, low cost and easy to administer,"" Murphy says. ""We also recommend additional studies into the different types of acupressure and how they could more specifically be targeted to patients based on their symptoms."" "
Science Daily,Meaningful PTSD Symptom Decrease May Lower Type 2 Diabetes Risk,Mind & Brain,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142734.htm,"   The study, ""Clinically Meaningful PTSD Improvement and Risk for Type 2 Diabetes,"" by Jeffrey Scherrer, Ph.D., professor in Family and Community Medicine at SLU, was published online Aug. 21 in JAMA Psychiatry. ""Some long-term chronic health conditions associated with PTSD may be less likely to occur among patients who experience clinically meaningful symptom reduction either through treatment or spontaneous improvement,"" Scherrer said. PTSD affects up to 12 percent of civilians and nearly 30 percent of the veteran population. Those with PTSD are at risk for other health issues and improvement in PTSD symptoms is associated with parallel improvements in depression, emotional well-being, sleep, blood pressure and general physical health. PTSD is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which may be explained by the high prevalence of obesity, glucose dysregulation, inflammation, metabolic syndrome and depression among those diagnosed with PTSD versus those without PTSD. This retrospective cohort study reviewed Veterans Health Affairs medical record data from 2008 to 2015. The researchers randomly selected 5,916 cases from among a veteran patient population aged 18 to 70 who had more than two visits to PTSD specialty care between 2008 and 2012. The patients were followed through until 2015. After applying eligibility criteria, 1,598 patients with PTSD and free of diabetes risk were available for analysis. Clinically meaningful symptom reduction is a decrease of 20 points on the PTSD Checklist score. The research found the results were independent of numerous demographic, psychiatric and physical comorbidities. The sample was 84.3 percent male, 66 percent Caucasian and 22 percent African-American. The mean age of the patients was 42. The association was also independent of the number of PTSD psychotherapy sessions used. ""In patients with only PTSD, clinically meaningful PCL decrease is associated with lower risk for diabetes and in patients with PTSD and depression, we found improvement in PTSD was coupled with a decrease in depression,"" Scherrer said. ""Thus decreased risk for type 2 diabetes appears to follow large PTSD symptom decrease and in patients with both PTSD and depression, improvement in both conditions may be necessary to reduce risk for type 2 diabetes."" ""Surprisingly, clinically meaningful PTSD improvement was not associated with a change in BMI and A1C values."" A prospective study is needed to advance research, Scherrer says, due in part to the limitations of medical record data. Such a study could determine if large decreases in PTSD checklist scores are associated with improved insulin resistance and reduced inflammation. Take-aways The observational study examined whether veterans who experienced a greater reduction in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had an associated lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The analysis included medical records from almost 1,600 veterans who received PTSD specialty care and had repeated completion of the PTSD Checklist as part of their treatment at the VA. Patients with versus patients without clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptoms had a 49 percent lower risk for type 2 diabetes over a 3-6-year follow-up period. In patients with PTSD and depression, improvement in both conditions was associated with lower risk for diabetes. "
Science Daily,Most Patients Willing to Share Medical Records for Research Purposes,Living Well,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163816.htm,"   But the looming, lingering question is to what degree are individual patients willing to share medical records and biospecimens with researchers and institutions beyond their personal physician or health care system? And more specifically, how should patients be asked and what information are they most likely to share? In a novel attempt to answer these questions, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, with collaborators in California, North Carolina and Texas, asked patients at two academic hospitals to respond to a variety of different approaches seeking to share their medical data with other researchers. The findings are published in the August 21, 2019 online issue of JAMA Network Open. The survey was conducted at two academic hospitals -- UC San Diego Health and UC Irvine Health between May 1, 2017 and September 31, 2018. Participants were randomly selected to one of four options with different layouts and formats for indicating sharing preferences: opt-in simple, opt-in detailed, opt-out simple and opt-out detailed. In the simple forms, there were 18 categories where participants could choose to share information; in the detailed forms, there were 59 items. The items ranged from demographics like age, sex and race and socioeconomic status to lab results (genetic tests, drug screening, etc.), imaging (x-rays, MRI) and biospecimens (blood, urine, tissue). Participants were also asked to what degree they would be willing to share their medical data: with researchers only in the same health care organization or with those working at other nonprofit or for-profit institutions. Among 1,800 eligible participants, 1,246 completed the data sharing survey and were included in the analysis and 850 responded to a satisfaction survey. Slightly less than 60 percent were female and slightly less than 80 percent were white. The mean age was 51 years old. More than 67 percent of survey participants indicated they would share all items with researchers from the home institution (which patients presumably already trust with their health care), with progressively smaller percentages for sharing with other nonprofit institutions or with other for-profit institutions. Many of the respondents indicated that they were only unwilling to share a few items. ""These results are important because data from a single institution is often insufficient to achieve statistical significance in research findings,"" said the study's senior author, Lucila Ohno-Machado, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, associate dean for informatics and technology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine and chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at UC San Diego Health. ""When sample sizes are small, it is unclear whether the research findings generalize to a larger population. Additionally, in alignment with the concept of personalized medicine, it is important to see whether it is possible to personalize privacy settings for sharing clinical data."" Generally speaking, the current state of affairs concerning the sharing of ""anonymized"" patient health data for secondary research is uneven and unsettled. It has been shown that anonymization methods -- in which data sets are either encrypted or stripped of personally identifiable information -- are not 100 percent effective. Since 2013, newly enrolled patients are required to proactively consent to sharing their personal health information for research studies or future secondary use. In California, a patient's specific permission is required to share mental health, substance abuse, HIV status and genetic information, but other items or conditions are not specified. In many states, there is no requirement for a patient's specific permission on these types of items before they can be shared. Today, for practical purposes, patients have the option to decline any part of their medical record be used for research. They cannot indicate what types of research or researcher should be able to obtain their records. Almost three-quarters of respondents -- 67.1 percent -- said they would be willing to share all items with researchers from their health care institutions; almost one-quarter said they would be willing to share all items with all interested researchers, a finding the authors said was reassuring and could help in the planning of studies based on EHRs and biospecimens that would be expected to be broadly shared. Equally encouraging: Less than 4 percent of participants said they were not willing to share any information with anyone. Ohno-Machado said the way in which preferences are elicited also has an influence. There was greater sharing per item when respondents were asked to opt-out than when they were asked to opt-in. Whether the form had details about the items or used broad categories did not have an influence on sharing. ""This is important because a simple form could be used in the future to elicit choices from all patients, saving their time without significantly affecting their privacy preferences,"" said Ohno-Machado. ""However, different rates of sharing are expected for opt-in and opt-out of sharing clinical records for research."" A key finding was that a majority of survey participants identified at least one item that they did not want to share with a particular type of researcher (for example, a scientist at another for-profit institution), though they were willing to share other items. ""This finding is important,"" wrote the authors, ""because the item to withhold may not be of relevance to a certain study, but the current all-or-nothing option, if chosen, would remove that patient's data from all research studies."" The authors said the survey's tiered-permission system that allows specific removal of data items or categories proves both doable and appealing to patients, in part because there are differences among individuals in where and with whom they share what. The findings, said the authors, trigger further questions about the ideal balance between giving patients the ability to choose what portions of their data they want to share for research and with whom and the ""greater good,"" i.e., how fast research can be accelerated for the benefit of all. ""Institutions currently make decisions on sharing on behalf of all patients who do not explicitly decline sharing. It is possible that asking patients directly would increase the amount of data shared for research. On the other hand, it is also possible that some types of research would suffer from small sample sizes if patients consistently decline certain categories of items,"" Ohno-Machado said. "
Science Daily,Scientists Unlock Secrets of Maternal/fetal Cellular Communication During Pregnancy,Living Well,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142731.htm,"   ""During pregnancy, there is constant communication between maternal and fetal cells using sacs filled with chemicals called exosomes,"" said senior author Ramkumar Menon, UTMB associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology. ""Our prior studies have shown that the fetal exosomes signal to the mother's body that her/his organs have fully matured, which triggers the labor and delivery process. Given this, we sought out to learn more about the extent and capabilities of this communication system in order to develop new ways to monitor and support the fetus during pregnancy."" To test exosome trafficking and function, the research team used mice that were genetically engineered to have certain exosome proteins glow florescent red and green when blood and tissue samples are stained and viewed under a microscope in order to distinguish between the fetal and maternal exosomes. The researchers learned that isolating and tracking fetal exosomes travelling to the maternal side is a useful indicator of the fetus's health and development that can be measured in minimally invasive maternal blood samples. Likewise, they now know that trafficking of exosomes from the maternal side to the fetus produces functional changes. ""We've just received a $ 1.5 million three-year contract to test a novel approach in treating preterm birth,"" said Menon. ""We will test the usefulness of drugs enclosed in exosomes that can potentially cross the placenta barrier, reach the fetus and prevent fetal inflammation, a major cause of preterm birth for which there is currently no drug treatment. Fetal inflammatory response is primarily responsible for preterm delivery, which impacts 15 million pregnancies yearly and responsible for 1 million neonatal deaths."" "
Science Daily,New Cyclization Reactions for Synthesizing Macrocyclic Drug Leads,Matter & Energy,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142721.htm,"   In fact, macrocycles show a great ability to bind difficult targets that have flat, featureless surfaces. This has raised tremendous interest in the pharmaceutical industry, which is particularly interested in macrocyclic compounds with a molecular weight below 1 KDa, which would be small enough to cross the cell membrane and reach intracellular disease targets, e.g. proteins or even genes in the cell. Still, there is a hurdle: there aren't enough suitable macrocycle libraries or methods to generate such small macrocycles. The compound libraries that pharmaceutical companies use today in high-throughput screens do contain 1-2 million different molecules, but those are mostly classical small molecules and only a handful are actual macrocyclics -- at most, only a few hundred. This is too small a number for the screens to yield good hits when searching for possible drug candidates against challenging disease targets. Now, scientists at EPFL have found a way to generate libraries of more than 9,000 of macrocyclic molecules below 1 KDa, all with high structural diversity. ""Initially, what we wanted to do is generate orally available or cell-permeable macrocyclic drugs,"" says Professor Christian Heinis, whose lab led the study. The libraries were generated by ""cyclizing"" short linear peptides in combination with diverse linker reagents, which promote chemical bonding. The yields of the macrocyclization reactions turned out to be so efficient that there was no need for purification. And in a key breakthrough, the new method also led to the discovery of surprisingly efficient macrocyclization reactions based on the ligation of thiol and amino groups of short peptides. The work was supported by EPFL's Biomolecular Screening Facility (BSF), headed by Gerardo Turcatti. ""EPFL has already developed the liquid handling processes to perform the combinatorial synthesis and to screen the macrocyclic compound libraries,"" he says. Screening identified binders of different disease targets, including inhibitors of thrombin, an important target of coagulation disorders. X-ray structure analysis of a thrombin inhibitor by partners in Italy showed a snug fit of the macrocycle to its target. Heinis's lab is now further developing the macrocycle synthesis approach in order to screen even larger combinatorial libraries. Working closely with the BSF with the support of NCCR Chemical Biology, the next step is to generate macrocyclic inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions, for which we currently have no good inhibitors.

Science Daily,Can Pomegranate Juice Protect the Infant Brain?,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142719.htm,"   ""Our study provides preliminary evidence suggesting potential protective effects for newborns exposed to pomegranate juice while in utero,"" said senior author Terrie Inder, MBCHB, chair of the Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine at the Brigham. ""These findings warrant continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols in at-risk newborns, such as those with hypoxic-ischemic injury."" In cases of IUGR, a baby in the womb is measuring small for its gestational age, often because of issues with the placenta, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. One out of every 10 babies is considered to have IUGR. The process of birth itself can further decrease blood flow or oxygen to the baby, including to the baby's brain. If this is very severe, it can result in a condition known as hypoxic-ischemic injury, which contributes to almost one-quarter of newborn deaths worldwide. Polyphenols, which include tannic acid and ellagitannins, are part of a class of antioxidants found in many foods and beverages, including nuts, berries, red wine and teas. Pomegranate juice is a particularly rich source of these molecules. Polyphenols are known to cross the blood-brain barrier, and studies in animal models have demonstrated protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. To date, no clinical studies had evaluated the potential effects of giving pregnant women pomegranate juice to protect the brains of at-risk newborns. The current randomized, controlled, double-blinded study enrolled 78 mothers from Barnes-Jewish Hospital obstetric clinic in St. Louis with IUGR diagnosed at 24-43 weeks' gestation. Women were randomized to receive 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily or a taste/calorie matched placebo that was polyphenol free. Women drank the juice daily from enrollment until delivery. The team measured several aspects of brain development and injury, including infant brain macrostructure, microstructural organization and functional connectivity. While the team did not observe differences in brain macrostructure, they did find regional differences in white matter microstructure and functional connectivity. ""These measures tell us about how the brain is developing functionally,"" said Inder. ""We saw no difference in brain growth and baby growth, but we did see improvement in cabling network and brain development measured by synchronous blood flow and visual development of the brain."" The authors note that the findings warrant the need for a larger, rigorously designed clinical trial to allow continued investigation into the potential neuroprotective effects of polyphenols. Such a study is now underway at the Brigham. ""We plan to continue investigating these exciting findings,"" said Inder. ""While the preliminary evidence shows promise, additional study and replication is needed."" "
Science Daily,"20-Million-Year-Old Skull Suggests Complex Brain Evolution in Monkeys, Apes",Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142715.htm,"   ""Human beings have exceptionally enlarged brains, but we know very little about how far back this key trait started to develop,"" said lead author Xijun Ni, a research associate at the Museum and a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ""This is in part because of the scarcity of well-preserved fossil skulls of much more ancient relatives."" As part of a long-term collaboration with John Flynn, the Museum's Frick Curator of Fossil Mammals, Ni spearheaded a detailed study of an exceptional 20-million-year-old anthropoid fossil discovered high in the Andes mountains of Chile, the skull and only known specimen of Chilecebus carrascoensis. ""Through more than three decades of partnership and close collaboration with the National Museum of Chile, we have recovered many remarkable new fossils from unexpected places in the rugged volcanic terrain of the Andes,"" Flynn said. ""Chilecebus is one of those rare and truly spectacular fossils, revealing new insights and surprising conclusions every time new analytical methods are applied to studying it."" Previous research by Flynn, Ni, and their colleagues on Chilecebus provided a rough idea of the animal's encephalization, or the brain size relative to body size. A high encephalization quotient (EQ) signifies a large brain for an animal of a given body size. Most primates have high EQs relative to other mammals, although some primates -- especially humans and their closest relatives -- have even higher EQs than others. The latest study takes this understanding one step further, illustrating the patterns across the broader anthropoid family tree. The resulting ""PEQ"" -- or phylogenetic encephalization quotient, to correct for the effects of close evolutionary relationships -- for Chilecebus is relatively small, at 0.79. Most living monkeys, by comparison, have PEQs ranging from 0.86 to 3.39, with humans coming in at an extraordinary 13.46 and having expanded brain sizes dramatically even compared to nearest relatives. With this new framework, the researchers confirmed that cerebral enlargement occurred repeatedly and independently in anthropoid evolution, in both New and Old World lineages, with occasional decreases in size. High-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning and 3D digital reconstruction of the inside of Chilecebus' skull gave the research team new insights into the anatomy of its brain. In modern primates, the size of the visual and olfactory centers in the brain are negatively correlated, reflecting a potential evolutionary ""trade-off,"" meaning that visually acute primates typically have weaker senses of smell. Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that a small olfactory bulb in Chilecebus was not counterbalanced by an amplified visual system. This finding indicates that in primate evolution the visual and olfactory systems were far less tightly coupled than was widely assumed. Other findings: The size of the opening for the optic nerve suggests that Chilecebus was diurnal. Also, the infolding (sulcus) pattern of the brain of Chilecebus, although far simpler than in most modern anthropoids, possesses at least seven pairs of sulcal grooves and is surprisingly complex for such an ancient primate. ""During his epic voyage on the Beagle, Charles Darwin explored the mouth of the canyon where Chilecebus was discovered 160 years later. Shut out of the higher cordillera by winter snow, Darwin was inspired by 'scenes of the highest interest' his vista presented. This exquisite fossil, found just a few kilometers east of where Darwin stood, would have thrilled him,"" said co-author André Wyss from the University of California Santa Barbara. "
Science Daily,Parasite Needs Chemical (Lipid/nutrient) in Cat Intestines for Sex,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821173713.htm,"   Toxoplasma can live asexually in any mammal, including humans. But it forms gametes (sexual cells) only in cats, a restriction that has long been recognized, but whose reason was not understood. The authors suspected something was missing when reproducing the infections in vitro and not observing sexual development. It is known that fungi require linoleic acid for sexual development. To test Toxoplasma's requirement for the same lipid, they generated cat intestinal organoids -- three-dimensional ""test tube"" models that share several essential properties with actual intestines -- and showed that linoleic acid was required for sexual reproduction of the parasite. Cats lack an enzyme called delta-6-desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, accounting for the peculiarly high levels of linoleic acid in the cat intestine, but not in other mammals. When the authors supplemented the diet of mice with linoleic acid, and added a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, Toxoplasma could complete the sexual phase of its life cycle in the mouse intestine. Toxoplasma is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the US, according to CDC. The most common route of infection for human is by consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked meat. Cat litter, after 24-48 of being cleaned, can also a source of Toxoplasma infection. However, cats can only shed oocysts once in their life time. Pregnant women are urged to avoid eating raw or undercooked meat, as also avoiding cleaning the litterbox after 48 hours, to prevent Toxoplasma infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis can have potentially serious consequences for the unborn child. An improved understanding of the parasite life cycle stemming from this study may lead to production of vaccines that could inhibit Toxoplasma's sexual reproduction or the transmission of Toxoplasma to livestock.

Science Daily,Understanding the Animal Brain Could Help Robots Wash Your Dishes,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821173704.htm,"   Anthony Zador, M.D., Ph.D., has spent his career working to describe, down to the individual neuron, the complex neural networks that make up a living brain. But he started his career studying artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs, which are the computing systems behind the recent AI revolution, are inspired by the branching networks of neurons in animal and human brains. However, this broad concept is usually where the inspiration ends. In a perspective piece recently published in Nature Communications, Zador describes how improved learning algorithms are allowing AI systems to achieve superhuman performance on an increasing number of more complex problems like chess and poker. Yet, machines are still stumped by what we consider to be the simplest problems. Solving this paradox may finally enable robots to learn how to do something as organic as stalking prey or building a nest, or even something as human and mundane as doing the dishes-a task that Google CEO Eric Schmidt once called ""literally the number one request... but an extraordinarily difficult problem"" for a robot. ""The things that we find hard, like abstract thought or chess playing, are actually not the hard thing for machines. The things that we find easy, like interacting with the physical world, that's what's hard,"" Zador explained. ""The reason that we think it's easy is that we had half a billion years of evolution that has wired up our circuits so that we do it effortlessly."" That's why Zador writes that the secret to quick learning might not be a perfected general learning algorithm. Instead, he suggests that biological neural networks sculpted by evolution provide a kind of scaffolding to facilitate the quick and easy learning for specific kinds of tasks-usually those crucial for survival. For an example, Zador points to your backyard. ""You have squirrels that can jump from tree to tree within a few weeks after birth, but we don't have mice learning the same thing. Why not?"" Zador said. ""It's because one is genetically predetermined to become a tree-dwelling creature."" Zador suggests that one result of this genetic predisposition is the innate circuitry that helps guide an animal's early learning. However, these scaffolding networks are far less generalized than the perceived panacea of machine learning that most AI experts are pursuing. If ANNs identified and adapted similar sets of circuitry, Zador argues, the future's household robots might just one day surprise us with clean dishes. "
Science Daily,Shift to More Intense Rains Threatens Historic Italian Winery,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163820.htm,"   Researchers found a shift from steady, gentle rains to more intense storms over the past several decades has led to earlier grape harvests, even when seasonal rainfall totals are similar. Early harvests can prevent grapes from fully developing the complex flavors found in wines. Intense precipitation events represent the second most important factor, behind temperature, in predicting when grapes were ready at one vineyard that's been producing wine using traditional methods since the 1650s and recording harvest dates for 200 years, the scientists said. ""Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the increasing tendency of precipitation intensity could exacerbate the effect of global warming on some premium wines that have been produced for almost 400 years,"" said Piero Di Carlo, associate professor of atmospheric sciences at D'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara in Italy. Because the winery doesn't use irrigation or other modern techniques, its harvest records more accurately reflect what was happening with the climate each year. Scientists gathered local meteorological data and used models to simulate what factors likely most influenced grape readiness. They recently reported their findings in the journal Science of the Total Environment. ""Because they haven't changed their techniques, a lot of other variables that may have changed harvest date are taken out of the picture,"" said William Brune, distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State. ""It makes it cleaner statistically to look at things like precipitation intensity and temperature, and I think that's one reason why we were able to tease these findings out."" Previous studies have established a link between higher temperatures and earlier grape harvest dates at other European wineries. Higher rainfall totals can help offset advances in harvest dates caused by rising temperatures, but the impact of rain intensity was not well understood, the scientists said. Steady rains are better for agriculture because heavy storms cause water runoff, and plants and soils can absorb less moisture. The findings indicate a feedback in the climate system -- the increase in temperature precipitates more intense rainfall, which further advances the grape harvest date, according to the researchers. Three wine barrels in a row ""We really need to think more broadly about how increases in temperature may have an influence on other variables and how that amplification can affect not only this winery, but all wineries, and in fact all agriculture,"" Brune said. ""I think it's a cautionary tale in that regard."" The winery in the study faces particularly difficult challenges because mitigation strategies like irrigation would change the way the vineyard has cultivated its grapes for hundreds of years. Moving to higher elevations may be an option, but land is limited, and such a change could have other, unforeseen impacts on the wine, the scientists said. ""If we would like to keep our excellence in terms of production of wine, but also in other agricultural sectors, we have to be careful about climate change,"" said Di Carlo, lead author on the study. ""Even if we can use some strategies to adapt, we don't know if we can compensate for all of the effects. We could lose a valuable part of our local economy and tradition."" "
Science Daily,Scientists Probe How Distinct Liquid Organelles in Cells Are Created,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163818.htm,"   One way these biological compounds stay organized is through membrane-less organelles (MLOs) -- wall-less liquid droplets made from proteins and RNA that clump together and stay separate from the rest of the cellular stew. You can think of these fluid compartments as being akin to oil droplets in water. MLOs facilitate storage of molecules within cells and can serve as a center of biochemical activity, recruiting molecules needed to carry out essential cellular reactions. Though these droplets are plentiful within cells, they represent an emerging field of study in cell biology. Little is known about how they are created and maintained with unique functionalities. To address this knowledge gap, one University at Buffalo laboratory is using cutting-edge scientific techniques to probe the fundamental properties of how MLOs work. The research is led by Priya R. Banerjee, PhD, an assistant professor of physics in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. In a paper published on Aug. 21 in Scientific Reports, Banerjee and colleagues report that MLOs may be highly sensitive to the level of divalent cations inside cells. This is important because divalent calcium and magnesium ions aid in cellular signaling and are vital to life. In experiments, MLOs containing both proteins and RNA form when divalent cations were found in low concentrations. But when concentrations of these cations were high, liquid organelles holding only RNA molecules were favored. The tests were systematically performed using controlled model systems comprising protein and RNA molecules floating in a buffer solution. ""It's interesting because you haven't changed the basic ingredients,"" Banerjee says. ""But when you alter the ionic environment, you find that these organelles are highly tunable. They 'switch' from one type to the other, with each type having a distinct internal design."" The study was led by Banerjee and Ashok Deniz, PhD, associate professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, a nonprofit medical research institution. The team demonstrated that fluctuations in divalent cations can profoundly tune the liquid properties of MLOs, altering the internal environment of the droplet. This is important since cells are believed to control some MLO functionality by changing their interior design. The concept of tunable intracellular droplet organelles is currently being actively investigated in Banerjee's lab at UB. In a separate paper published earlier in 2019, Banerjee and colleagues explored another fundamental property of MLOs: conditions that drive such droplets to switch from a fluid, liquidy state to a harder, gel-like state. ""The concept that protein and nucleic acid droplets can function as organelles in a cell has started shifting the paradigm of cell biology that is written in a textbook,"" Banerjee says. ""Reports started emerging from several different laboratories across the world that MLOs are relevant in gene regulation, protection of cells during stress, immune response and many other biological functions, as well as diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer. Therefore, understanding how MLOs are formed, tuned and altered in diseases are of key importance in the field now."" "
Science Daily,Separate Polarization and Brightness Channels Give Crabs the Edge Over Predators,Plants & Animals,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142717.htm,"   The key advantage of this method is that the separate visual channels provide a greater range of information for the crab. The research also suggests that when it comes to detecting predators', polarisation can provide a more reliable source of information than brightness. The researchers from the Ecology of Vision Group in the School of Biological Sciences tested how crabs responded to visual stimuli presented on a special computer monitor developed by the lab. By changing the polarisation and brightness of the stimuli the researchers were able to test whether certain combinations of polarisation and brightness appeared to cancel each other out. Sam Smithers, PhD student in the School of Biological Sciences and one of the authors, said: ""If you look through Polaroid sunglasses at the sky, you will notice that the brightness changes when you tilt your head. This is because the light from the sky is polarised and your sunglasses allow you to see differences in polarisation as differences in brightness."" ""For our experiments we tested whether fiddler crabs see the same effect. However, we discovered that the crabs detect polarisation in a completely different way to this and polarisation has no effect on how the crabs detect the brightness of a scene."" The next step for the research team is to find out what happens to the brightness and polarisation information deeper in the brain. This will help them to understand how and when polarisation and colour information provide a visual advantage to the viewer. "

Science Daily,Ocean Temperatures Turbocharge April Tornadoes Over Great Plains Region,Earth & Climate,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142729.htm,"   2019 has seen the second highest number of January to May tornadoes in the United States since 2000, with several deadly outbreaks claiming more than 38 fatalities. Why some years are very active, whereas others are relatively calm, has remained an unresolved mystery for scientists and weather forecasters. Climate researchers from the IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), South Korea have found new evidence implicating a role for ocean temperatures in US tornado activity, particularly in April. Analyzing a large number of atmospheric data and climate computer model experiments, the scientists discovered that a cold tropical Pacific and/or a warm Gulf of Mexico are likely to generate large-scale atmospheric conditions that enhance thunderstorms and a tornado-favorable environment over the Southern Great Plains. This particular atmospheric situation, with alternating high- and low-pressure centers located in the central Pacific, Eastern United States and over the Gulf of Mexico, is known as the negative Pacific North America (PNA) pattern. According to the new research, ocean temperatures can boost this weather pattern in April. The corresponding high pressure over the Gulf of Mexico then funnels quickly-rotating moist air into the Great Plains region, which in turn fuels thunderstorms and tornadoes. ""Previous studies have overlooked the temporal evolution of ocean-tornado linkages. We found a clear relationship in April, but not in May ,"" says Dr. Jung-Eun Chu, lead author of the study and research fellow at the ICCP. ""Extreme tornado occurrences in the past, such as those in April 2011, were consistent with this blueprint. Cooler than normal conditions in the tropical Pacific and a warm Gulf of Mexico intensify the negative PNA, which then turbocharges the atmosphere with humid air and more storm systems,"" explains Axel Timmermann, Director of the ICCP and Professor at Pusan National University. ""Seasonal ocean temperature forecasts for April, which many climate modeling centers issue regularly, may further help in predicting the severity of extreme weather conditions over the United States,"" says June-Yi Lee, Professor at Pusan National University and Coordinating Lead Author of the 6th Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""How Global Warming will influence extreme weather over North America, including tornadoes still remains unknown ,"" says. Dr. Chu. To address this question, the researchers are currently conducting ultra-high-resolution supercomputer simulations on the institute's new supercomputer Aleph. "

Science Daily,Earliest Evidence of Artificial Cranial Deformation in Croatia During 5th-6th Century,Fossils & Ruins,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142725.htm,"   The Hermanov vinograd archaeological site in Osijek Croatia has been known since the 1800s. A new pit excavated in 2013 contained three human skeletons dating to 415-560 CE, during the Great Migration Period, a time of significant movement and interaction of various European cultures. Two of the skeletons showed dramatically modified head shapes, one whose skull had been lengthened obliquely and another whose skull had been compressed and heightened. This is the oldest known incidence of Artificial Cranial Deformation (ACD) in Croatia. ACD is the practice of modifying the skull from infancy to create a permanently altered shape, often to signify social status. In this study, genetic, isotopic and skeletal analysis of the bodies revealed that all were males between 12 and 16 years of age at death and that they all suffered from malnutrition. They are not obviously of different social status, but genetic analysis found that the two with cranial modifications exhibited very distinct ancestries, one from the Near East and the other from East Asia. The latter is the first individual from the Migration Period with a majority East Asian ancestry to be found in Europe. The authors suggest the ACD observed here may have functioned to distinguish members of different cultural groups as these groups interacted closely during the Migration Period. From the evidence at hand, it is unclear if these individuals were associated with Huns, Ostrogoths, or another population. It is also unclear whether the use of ACD to signify cultural identity was a widespread practice or something peculiar to these individuals. Dr Novak adds: ""The most striking observation, based on nuclear ancient DNA, is that these individuals vary greatly in their genetic ancestries: the individual without artificial cranial deformation shows broadly West Eurasian associated-ancestry, the individual with the so-called circular-erect type cranial deformation has Near Eastern associated-ancestry, while the individual with the elongated skull has East Asian ancestry.""

Science Daily,Nordic Bronze Age Attracted Wide Variety of Migrants to Denmark,Fossils & Ruins,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821142723.htm,"   The 2nd and 3rd millennia BC are known to have been a period of significant migrations in western Europe, including the movement of steppe populations into more temperate regions. Starting around 1600 BC, southern Scandinavia became closely linked to long-distance metal trade elsewhere in Europe, which gave rise to a Nordic Bronze Age and a period of significant wealth in the region of present-day Denmark. In this study, Frei and colleagues investigated whether patterns of migration changed during this Nordic Bronze Age. They examined skeletal remains of 88 individuals from 37 localities across present-day Denmark. Since strontium isotopes in tooth enamel can record geographic signatures from an early age, analysis of such isotopes was used to determine individuals' regions of provenance. Radiocarbon dating was used to determine the age of each skeleton and physical anthropological analyses were also conducted to add information on sex, age and potential injuries or illness. From c. 1600 BC onwards, around the beginning of the Nordic Bronze Age, the geographic signal of migrants became more varied, an indication that this period of economic growth attracted migrants from a wide variety of foreign locales, possibly including more distant regions. The authors suggest this might reflect the establishment of new cultural alliances as southern Scandinavia flourished economically. They propose that further study using ancient DNA may further elucidate such social dynamics at large scales. Co-author Kristian Kristiansen notes: ""Around 1600 BC, the amount of metal coming into southern Scandinavia increased dramatically, arriving mostly from the Italian Alps, whereas tin came from Cornwall in south England. Our results support the development of highly international trade, a forerunner for the Viking Age period."" Karin Frei adds: ""Our data indicates a clear shift in human mobility at the breakthrough point of the Nordic Bronze Age, when an unprecedented rich period in southern Scandinavia emerged. This suggests to us that these aspects might have been closely related."" "
Science Daily,Most Patients Willing to Share Medical Records for Research Purposes,Science & Society,2019-08-21,-,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190821163816.htm,"   But the looming, lingering question is to what degree are individual patients willing to share medical records and biospecimens with researchers and institutions beyond their personal physician or health care system? And more specifically, how should patients be asked and what information are they most likely to share? In a novel attempt to answer these questions, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, with collaborators in California, North Carolina and Texas, asked patients at two academic hospitals to respond to a variety of different approaches seeking to share their medical data with other researchers. The findings are published in the August 21, 2019 online issue of JAMA Network Open. The survey was conducted at two academic hospitals -- UC San Diego Health and UC Irvine Health between May 1, 2017 and September 31, 2018. Participants were randomly selected to one of four options with different layouts and formats for indicating sharing preferences: opt-in simple, opt-in detailed, opt-out simple and opt-out detailed. In the simple forms, there were 18 categories where participants could choose to share information; in the detailed forms, there were 59 items. The items ranged from demographics like age, sex and race and socioeconomic status to lab results (genetic tests, drug screening, etc.), imaging (x-rays, MRI) and biospecimens (blood, urine, tissue). Participants were also asked to what degree they would be willing to share their medical data: with researchers only in the same health care organization or with those working at other nonprofit or for-profit institutions. Among 1,800 eligible participants, 1,246 completed the data sharing survey and were included in the analysis and 850 responded to a satisfaction survey. Slightly less than 60 percent were female and slightly less than 80 percent were white. The mean age was 51 years old. More than 67 percent of survey participants indicated they would share all items with researchers from the home institution (which patients presumably already trust with their health care), with progressively smaller percentages for sharing with other nonprofit institutions or with other for-profit institutions. Many of the respondents indicated that they were only unwilling to share a few items. ""These results are important because data from a single institution is often insufficient to achieve statistical significance in research findings,"" said the study's senior author, Lucila Ohno-Machado, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, associate dean for informatics and technology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine and chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at UC San Diego Health. ""When sample sizes are small, it is unclear whether the research findings generalize to a larger population. Additionally, in alignment with the concept of personalized medicine, it is important to see whether it is possible to personalize privacy settings for sharing clinical data."" Generally speaking, the current state of affairs concerning the sharing of ""anonymized"" patient health data for secondary research is uneven and unsettled. It has been shown that anonymization methods -- in which data sets are either encrypted or stripped of personally identifiable information -- are not 100 percent effective. Since 2013, newly enrolled patients are required to proactively consent to sharing their personal health information for research studies or future secondary use. In California, a patient's specific permission is required to share mental health, substance abuse, HIV status and genetic information, but other items or conditions are not specified. In many states, there is no requirement for a patient's specific permission on these types of items before they can be shared. Today, for practical purposes, patients have the option to decline any part of their medical record be used for research. They cannot indicate what types of research or researcher should be able to obtain their records. Almost three-quarters of respondents -- 67.1 percent -- said they would be willing to share all items with researchers from their health care institutions; almost one-quarter said they would be willing to share all items with all interested researchers, a finding the authors said was reassuring and could help in the planning of studies based on EHRs and biospecimens that would be expected to be broadly shared. Equally encouraging: Less than 4 percent of participants said they were not willing to share any information with anyone. Ohno-Machado said the way in which preferences are elicited also has an influence. There was greater sharing per item when respondents were asked to opt-out than when they were asked to opt-in. Whether the form had details about the items or used broad categories did not have an influence on sharing. ""This is important because a simple form could be used in the future to elicit choices from all patients, saving their time without significantly affecting their privacy preferences,"" said Ohno-Machado. ""However, different rates of sharing are expected for opt-in and opt-out of sharing clinical records for research."" A key finding was that a majority of survey participants identified at least one item that they did not want to share with a particular type of researcher (for example, a scientist at another for-profit institution), though they were willing to share other items. ""This finding is important,"" wrote the authors, ""because the item to withhold may not be of relevance to a certain study, but the current all-or-nothing option, if chosen, would remove that patient's data from all research studies."" The authors said the survey's tiered-permission system that allows specific removal of data items or categories proves both doable and appealing to patients, in part because there are differences among individuals in where and with whom they share what. The findings, said the authors, trigger further questions about the ideal balance between giving patients the ability to choose what portions of their data they want to share for research and with whom and the ""greater good,"" i.e., how fast research can be accelerated for the benefit of all. ""Institutions currently make decisions on sharing on behalf of all patients who do not explicitly decline sharing. It is possible that asking patients directly would increase the amount of data shared for research. On the other hand, it is also possible that some types of research would suffer from small sample sizes if patients consistently decline certain categories of items,"" Ohno-Machado said. "

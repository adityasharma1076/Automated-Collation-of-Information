ACM,"Waterloo Researchers Develop 200X Faster, Low-Cost Network for 5G Connectivity",ACM,2019-08-29,-,https://www.ibtimes.sg/waterloo-researchers-develop-200-times-faster-low-cost-network-5g-connectivity-32273,"       Waterloo Researchers Develop 200X Faster, Low-Cost Network for 5G Connectivity     International Business TimesSoorya KiranAugust 29, 2019   Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada have developed a more affordable and efficient technique to enable 5G wireless connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The mmX millimeter wave network delivers multi-gigahertz of unlicensed bandwidth, 200-fold more bandwidth than that allocated to current Wi-Fi and cellular networks. MmX supports a significantly higher bitrate than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Said Waterloo's Ali Abedi. ""Any sensor you have in your home, which traditionally used Wi-Fi and lower frequency, can now communicate using high-speed millimeter wave networks. Autonomous cars are also going to use a huge number of sensors in them which will be connected through wire; now you can make all of them wireless and more reliable.""                 "
ACM,Research Alliance Cements Split on AI Ethics,ACM,2019-08-23,-,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/08/23/new-research-alliance-cements-split-ai-ethics,"    Research Alliance Cements Split on AI Ethics     Inside Higher EdDavid MatthewsAugust 23, 2019   Germany, France, and Japan have partnered to underwrite research into human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), designed to respect privacy and transparency. The three countries issued a joint call for proposals, supported by an initial 7.4-million-euro ($8.2-million) in funding. The German Research Foundation's Susanne Sangenstedt said the partnering nations have common beliefs and standards for ethical AI development, with the call for research proposals seeking projects on AI democratization, data integrity for fairness, AI ethics to avoid gender/age discrimination, and technologies like machine learning, computer vision, and data mining. Holger Hoos at Leiden University in the Netherlands said China has put AI development under the control of the government-state, while the U.S. has permitted the private sector to oversee development. In contrast, Europe's approach has been to try to strike a balance among ""government, industry, and individual.""                 "

ACM,DHS Launches Smart City Sensor Pilot in St. Louis,ACM,2019-08-28,-,https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2019/08/dhs-launches-smart-city-sensor-pilot-st-louis/159517/,"       DHS Launches Smart City Sensor Pilot in St. Louis     NextGov.comBrandi VincentAugust 28, 2019   The U.S Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate is launching a pilot program in St. Louis, MO, that will study the integration of smart city technologies. Agency officials will work with the city and the Open Geospatial Consortium, a self-described “international voluntary consensus standards organization,” to help develop and assess the state of Smart Cities standards as they arise in the public safety arena. The results of the project also will serve as the basis for developing an open architecture for interoperable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Said program manager Norman Speicher, “There’s tremendous pressure on cities, right now. Many municipalities, I do hear that they are being pressured and that there’s this expectation that they know what ‘smart cities’ means—and it really means many things to many people.”                 "
ACM,Tech Tool Aims to Stop 'Bottlenecks' in Reaching U.K. Homeless,ACM,2019-08-28,-,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-homelessness-technology/tech-tool-aims-to-stop-bottlenecks-in-reaching-uk-homeless-idUSKCN1VI2B4,"    Tech Tool Aims to Stop 'Bottlenecks' in Reaching U.K. Homeless     ReutersSonia ElksAugust 28, 2019   The Homeless Link charity in the U.K. hopes to use a new algorithm to extend its aid to the homeless. The organization’s StreetLink app allows members of the public to flag the locations of “rough sleepers” (the homeless), and to request help for them from relevant local authorities or outreach organizations. The algorithm, developed by a team of students and technology workers, is designed to identify the most useful alerts in order to boost the number of homeless people offered assistance. Matt Harrison of the Streetlink organization, which works to connect the homeless with local services that can help them, said, ""If we can prioritize our scarce resources on the alerts which are mostly likely to result in a homeless person being found and helped, then we should do that.""

ACM,Facial Recognition: School ID Checks Lead to GDPR Fine,ACM,2019-08-27,-,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49489154,"       Facial Recognition: School ID Checks Lead to GDPR Fine     BBC NewsAugust 27, 2019   The Swedish Data Protection Authority (DPA) fined the municipality of Skelleftea 200,000 Swedish Krona ($20,700) for using facial recognition to track students, in violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Anderstorp High School used the technology to track 22 high school students for three weeks, to detect when each individual entered a classroom. GDPR restricts the use of facial imaging and the collection of other biometric data. The DPA said while the school obtained parents' permission to track the students, that was not legally sufficient to allow the school to capture personal data, as attendance could have been checked without video surveillance. The DPA said Skelleftea's local authority had illegally processed sensitive biometric data and failed to complete a sufficient impact assessment.                 "
ACM,Algorithms Aid Search for Source of Spacetime Rumbles,ACM,2019-08-28,-,https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/astrophysics/new-algorithms-lead-search-for-origins-of-spacetime-rumbles,"       Algorithms Aid Search for Source of Spacetime Rumbles     IEEE SpectrumMark AndersonAugust 28, 2019   Researchers working on the SAGUARO (Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona Observatories) project are using machine learning algorithms to help identify gravitational wavefronts that come from the collision of two neutron stars. The algorithms automatically consider each potential candidate source for more trivial explanations, such as a known variable star or an over-saturated image that caused noisy pixel data. This process allows the team to pare the list of possible gravitational wave sources to several dozen objects, a manageable number for follow-up by astronomers. The researchers' main goal is to improve the machine learning algorithms as much as possible in order to help them locate and identify a kilonova, a recently discovered astronomical event.

ACM,Giving Smart Vehicles Their Sense of Direction,ACM,2019-08-27,-,https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2019/august/smart-vehicles-sense-direction-algorithms-guoquan-huang/,"       Giving Smart Vehicles Their Sense of Direction     University of DelawareJulie StewartAugust 27, 2019   The University of Delaware's Guoquan Huang has developed algorithms to advance simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) as a technique for giving autonomous vehicles a sense of direction. Huang employs visual-inertial navigation systems, integrating cameras and inertial sensors to measure orientation and acceleration. The researcher then calculates motion and localization from the data collected by these components. Huang and colleagues have more accurately combined inertial measurements than previously possible via discrete-integration calculus, and open-sourced it on GitHub. The team also reconfigured SLAM as a formula for computing small increments of movement by sensor-equipped robots.                 "

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the California Institute of Technology have developed soft robotic systems inspired by origami that can move and change shape in response to external stimuli. The researchers used liquid crystal elastomers that change shape when exposed to heat, and utilized three-dimensional (3D) printing to create two types of soft hinges that fold at different temperatures. The team used its designs to build several soft robotic devices. Said Harvard’s Jennifer A. Lewis, “The ability to integrate active materials within 3D-printed objects enables the design and fabrication of entirely new classes of soft robotic matter.”                 "
ACM,AI Analysis Gives Guidance to Crisis Counselors,ACM,2019-08-21,-,https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/08/ai-analysis-gives-guidance-crisis-counselors,"    AI Analysis Gives Guidance to Crisis Counselors     Cornell Chronicle (NY)Louis DiPietroAugust 21, 2019   A study by Cornell University researchers and the Crisis Text Line crisis-counselor platform described how volunteer crisis counselors' use of language evolves. The team used state-of-the-art natural language processing to learn that the language employed by counselors systematically changes, based on their training and empathy for callers in distress, giving rise to unique voices for calming those distressed individuals. The researchers analyzed more than 1 million anonymized texts from about 3,500 counselors on the Crisis Text Line. Crisis Text Line's Robert Filbin said the study' insights will help the platform train and guide crisis counselors. Cornell's Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil said, ""This is an example of how natural language processing techniques can assist the development of skills in conversation-heavy professions.""

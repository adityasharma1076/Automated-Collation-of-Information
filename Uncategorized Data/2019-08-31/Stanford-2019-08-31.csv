Stanford,Ancient die-off greater than dinosaur extinction,Science & Technology,2019-08-31,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/28/ancient-die-off-greater-dinosaur-extinction/,"   Clues from Canadian rocks formed billions of year ago reveal a previously unknown loss of life even greater than that of the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, when Earth lost nearly three-quarters of its plant and animal species.

(Image credit: Malcolm Hodgskiss)  Rather than prowling animals, this die-off involved miniscule microorganisms that shaped the Earth’s atmosphere and ultimately paved the way for those larger animals to thrive. “This shows that even when biology on Earth is comprised entirely of microbes, you can still have what could be considered an enormous die-off event that otherwise is not recorded in the fossil record,” said Malcolm Hodgskiss, co-lead author of a new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Invisible clues Because this time period preceded complex life, researchers cannot simply dig up fossils to learn what was living 2 billion years ago. Even clues left behind in mud and rocks can be difficult to uncover and analyze. Instead, the group turned to barite, a mineral collected from the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay, Canada, that encapsulates a record of oxygen in the atmosphere. Those samples revealed that Earth experienced huge changes to its biosphere – the part of the planet occupied by living organisms – ending with an enormous drop in life approximately 2.05 billion years ago that may also be linked to declining oxygen levels. “The fact that this geochemical signature was preserved was very surprising,” Hodgskiss said. “What was especially unusual about these barites is that they clearly had a complex history.” Looking at the Earth’s productivity through ancient history provides a glimpse into how life is likely to behave over its entire existence – in addition to informing observations of atmospheres on planets outside our solar system. “The size of the biosphere through geologic time has always been one of our biggest questions in studying the history of the Earth,” said Erik Sperling, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford who was not involved with the study. “This new proxy demonstrates how interlinked the biosphere and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are.” Biological angle This relationship between the proliferation of life and atmospheric oxygen has given researchers new evidence of the hypothesized “oxygen overshoot.” According to this theory, photosynthesis from ancient microorganisms and the weathering of rocks created a huge amount of oxygen in the atmosphere that later waned as oxygen-emitting organisms exhausted their nutrient supply in the ocean and became less abundant. This situation is in contrast to the stable atmosphere we know on Earth today, where the oxygen created and consumed balances out. The researchers’ measurements of oxygen, sulfur and barium isotopes in barite support this oxygen overshoot hypothesis. The research helps scientists hone their estimates of the size of the oxygen overshoot by revealing the significant biological consequences of oxygen levels above or below the capacity of the planet. “Some of these oxygen estimates likely require too many microorganisms living in the ocean in Earth’s past,” said co-lead author Peter Crockford, a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science and Princeton University. “So we can now start to narrow in on what the composition of the atmosphere could have been through this biological angle.” Co-authors include researchers from Nanjing University, the University of Colorado Boulder and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution The research was supported by Stanford University McGee and Compton Grants, the Northern Scientific Training Program, NSERC, National Geographic, the American Philosophical Society, Geological Society of America and the Agouron Institute.

Stanford,How immigration in Seattle is driving urban change,Social Sciences,2019-08-31,-,https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/28/immigration-seattle-driving-urban-change/,"   A competitive housing market combined with the rapid rise of immigration is driving gentrification in Seattle’s low-cost black neighborhoods, according to a new study by Stanford sociologist Jackelyn Hwang.  Jackelyn Hwang examined gentrification in two very different cities: Chicago and Seattle. (Image credit: Steve Gladfelter)  While gentrification – which Hwang defines as an influx of investment and middle/upper-income residents into previously low-income neighborhoods – is more likely to occur in areas with higher populations of African Americans, areas with higher populations of Asians have not seen that same level of redevelopment in Seattle – a divergence Hwang’s data suggests is attributed to immigration. Her findings have been published in City & Community. This research follows similar work Hwang has carried out to better understand the relationship between neighborhood change and inequality in U.S. cities. Hwang hopes this research could help policymakers to consider long-term implications of economic redevelopment and investment, especially its effect on housing for disadvantaged residents. Here, Hwang found that arriving immigrants, who are predominantly Asian in Seattle, have concentrated in neighborhoods with more Asians, which has deterred gentrification in those areas. Combined with tight housing constraints, pressure has shifted to low-cost African American neighborhoods where an influx of investment and of middle- and upper-middle-class residents has led to demographic changes, Hwang said. “The results suggest that increased immigration to a city with a tight housing market may have unintended consequences on black urban neighborhoods,” said Hwang, an assistant professor of sociology in the Stanford School of Humanities & Sciences. “Because black urban residents may disproportionately face displacement and subsequent disadvantages on the housing market, the findings have implications for the future prospects of housing for blacks.” Seattle as a case study The study grew out of an earlier study Hwang conducted on gentrification in Chicago, a historically highly segregated city. Hwang found that the higher the percentage of African Americans in a neighborhood, the less likely it was to gentrify. She found that a threshold of 40 percent black residents in a neighborhood limited gentrification. Hwang wondered whether the same pattern she found in Chicago would occur in a city with lower levels of segregation that was also undergoing gentrification. Seattle was a compelling city to examine, Hwang said. “Because it has low segregation levels, Seattle doesn’t really have neighborhoods with these high concentrations of minorities. It actually has diverse neighborhoods that should satisfy these preferences,” Hwang said.  Seattle has low levels of segregation compared with many other cities, but is still experiencing some of the problems that come with gentrification. (Image credit: Getty Images)  Drawing on U.S. Census data, Hwang found that in the 1970s and 1980s, the same tendency to avoid neighborhoods that are primarily made up of minorities that she found in Chicago also occurred in Seattle: Gentrification was more likely to occur in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of whites. But in the 1990s and 2000s, a different trend emerged in Seattle. Unlike Chicago, Hwang found that gentrification began happening in neighborhoods with greater numbers of African Americans. However, she did not see the same pattern in Seattle’s areas with more Asians. Hwang wanted to know what led one minority area to gentrify over the other. So, she examined a wide set of possible explanations, including racial preferences of neighborhoods, race-based biases related to neighborhood quality, socioeconomic differences among African Americans and Asians in Seattle, and state policies such as transit options and public housing. Hwang found that none of those factors had an effect – except one: Neighborhoods where immigrants were settling did not gentrify. Seattle’s Asian population has rapidly increased, said Hwang. In 2013, 14 percent of the total population was comprised of Asians, double its size in 1980. Hwang’s analysis showed that a 1 percentage point increase in a neighborhood’s share of Asians in 1990 was associated with a 3.9 percent decrease in the odds of a neighborhood gentrifying by 2013. However, when there was a 1 percentage point increase in a neighborhood’s share of African Americans it was associated with a 3.4 percent increase in the odds of a neighborhood gentrifying. Unintended consequences Hwang found that as neighborhoods with higher shares of African Americans gentrified, these same areas also experienced large declines in their black populations. As cities transform, Hwang calls for policymakers to consider long-term implications and the unintended consequences of economic redevelopment and investment, especially the impact on housing for disadvantaged residents. “Given the long-standing inequities that blacks face when it comes to residential inequality and the housing market, the findings of this study call for targeted interventions to stem processes of neighborhood change exacerbating disadvantage for black urban residents,” said Hwang, noting that policies and programs should address racial wealth disparities. “Although black neighborhoods were once neglected and in decline, the recent investment and socioeconomic upgrading in these areas should not benefit only its landlords and newcomers.” While Seattle’s ethno-racial groups may be distinct from groups in highly segregated cities often studied in gentrification, her findings may extend to other diversifying cities in the United States with low levels of segregation and experiencing gentrification, such as Portland, Oregon, and Portland, Maine, Hwang said in the paper. Hwang is currently working on a national and multilevel analysis to check whether these patterns are happening elsewhere, as well as a nationwide study on gentrification’s consequences on segregation. The work was funded by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  "

The mmX millimeter wave network delivers multi-gigahertz of unlicensed bandwidth, 200-fold more bandwidth than that allocated to current Wi-Fi and cellular networks. MmX supports a significantly higher bitrate than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Said Waterloo's Ali Abedi. ""Any sensor you have in your home, which traditionally used Wi-Fi and lower frequency, can now communicate using high-speed millimeter wave networks. Autonomous cars are also going to use a huge number of sensors in them which will be connected through wire; now you can make all of them wireless and more reliable.""                 "

The algorithms automatically consider each potential candidate source for more trivial explanations, such as a known variable star or an over-saturated image that caused noisy pixel data. This process allows the team to pare the list of possible gravitational wave sources to several dozen objects, a manageable number for follow-up by astronomers. The researchers' main goal is to improve the machine learning algorithms as much as possible in order to help them locate and identify a kilonova, a recently discovered astronomical event.

Anderstorp High School used the technology to track 22 high school students for three weeks, to detect when each individual entered a classroom. GDPR restricts the use of facial imaging and the collection of other biometric data. The DPA said while the school obtained parents' permission to track the students, that was not legally sufficient to allow the school to capture personal data, as attendance could have been checked without video surveillance. The DPA said Skelleftea's local authority had illegally processed sensitive biometric data and failed to complete a sufficient impact assessment.                 "

Turing Award, died on Friday at the age of 93. Corbató spent his entire career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and oversaw a 1960s-era project called the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) that allowed multiple users in different locations to access a single computer simultaneously through telephone lines. The advent of time-sharing reinforced the revolutionary idea that computers could be used interactively. CTSS gave rise to a successor project called Multics (also led by Corbató), which inspired a team of researchers at Bell Labs to create Unix, a computer operating system that was adopted widely in the 1980s and 1990s. Corbató also came up with the idea for the computer password. CTSS passwords are widely considered to be among the earliest computer security mechanisms. "

This achievement builds on research from a team at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia, involving Deep Image Prior (DIP), a technique in which a multi-neural network is trained to replicate a specific image by looking for hierarchies of repeating features. The Weizmann researchers' Double-DIP process has two DIPs running in parallel, with each converting a random input into an image, and both images superimposed on and compared to a target image. The DIPs then independently modify their parameters so their combined image comes closer to the target. Dmitry Ulyanov of Moscow’s Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology said he and his collaborators designed DIP to study the importance of network architecture (versus data). "

The security vulnerability appears when the microprocessor tries to guess how to handle such an attack; if it guesses incorrectly, it will undo any work and start over. However, the incorrect guesses leave traces that can be exploited by attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre to retrieve information through so-called side-channels. The new method delays part of the speculation and uses another form of speculation to predict the expected value. The researchers found the new method did not reduce the performance of the processors by more than 11%, and with only a 7% energy usage increase. "

The researchers tweaked OpenAI's popular GPT-2 network to produce the ""Grover"" program, which serves as both a fake-news ""generator,"" and a ""discriminator"" to identify that false content. Grover produces disinformation after being fed a massive volume of curated human-written online news texts, supporting a language model that the network utilizes to create its own texts. The discriminator can identify Grover's fake text because it knows the generator's word-assembling ""decoder"" component chooses the most likely word combinations in a specific pattern. The researchers said innovations like Grover offer an ""exciting opportunity for defense against neural fake news,"" as ""[t]he best models for generating neural disinformation are also the best models at detecting it.""

The tool, called EternalBlue, was dumped online two years ago by an as-yet-unidentified hacker group, and in the ensuing years foreign intelligence agencies and state hackers have employed it to orchestrate malware infections. Recent activity indicates local U.S. governments with superannuated digital infrastructure and few defensive measures are now prime targets. Former NSA operators said EternalBlue was originally designed to exploit a vulnerability in unpatched Microsoft software, and used extensively for intelligence gathering and counterterrorism. The vulnerability lets hackers spread malware faster and to a greater extent than they otherwise would, and hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide remain imperiled, despite Microsoft's release of a patch.

The American Meteorological Society's Jordan Gerth said water vapor discharges a faint atmospheric signal at 23.8 gigahertz (GHz), which is very close to the 24-GHz frequency band that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been auctioning to 5G carriers. Satellites including NOAA's GOES-R monitor this frequency, gathering data fed to prediction simulations for incipient storms and weather systems. Gerth suggested wireless carriers could reduce 5G cellphone transmitters' power emissions so they will not mask the satellite's sensors.

The technique involves cutting a piece of paper, folding it into a funnel configuration, and taping it around the smartphone's microphone and speakers. By focusing sound into the patient's ear canal with the funnel, the phone can emit birdlike chirps at a particular frequency, via an app. The microphone identifies sound waves bouncing off the eardrum, then the app analyzes the echo for signs of fluid buildup; the app sends the user a text indicating the likelihood middle-ear fluid is present. Testing the system on 98 ears in pre-surgical patients older than 18 months demonstrated the technique could detect fluid as well as or better than specialized acoustic testing technology. "
211,ACM,Generating High-Quality Single Photons for Quantum Computing,ACM,2019-05-14,-,https://news.mit.edu/2019/single-photons-quantum-computing-0514,"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have created a method for generating, at room temperature, more single photons for carrying quantum information. A key challenge to developing a practical quantum computer is producing single photons with identical quantum properties, known as ""indistinguishable"" photons. Researchers previously found indistinguishability can be improved using emitters to funnel light through an optical cavity, which helps match their properties to the cavity. However, large cavities generate photons spontaneously, resulting in only a small fraction of photons staying in the cavity; smaller cavities extract higher percentages of photons, but they are of lower quality. The MIT team splits one cavity into two, each with a designated task: the small cavity handles the efficient extraction of photons, while the larger cavity stores them a bit longer to improve indistinguishability. The new coupled cavity generates photons with about 95% indistinguishability, compared to 80% for a single cavity, according to the researchers. "

The new set of Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) attacks exploit security flaws in the speculative execution process, in which a chip guesses which operations and data it will be asked to carry out beforehand, to expedite performance. The researchers determined speculative execution could be used to fool processors into capturing sensitive data en route between chip components, by concentrating on buffers positioned between components. The malicious code can leak the data the processor has grabbed from the buffer through the chip's cache, which when repeated millions of times successively would enable attackers to siphon streams of all the data the CPU accesses in real time.

The researchers' accuracy-aware privacy engine for data exploration (APEx) partly relieves data scientists of the need to reduce analytical accuracy to ensure client privacy. APEx renders scientists' queries and accuracy limits as suitable mechanisms meeting differential privacy, which mathematically defines privacy by studying output in such a manner that it is impossible to ascertain whether any individual's data was included in the original dataset. The mechanism then deduces minimal possible privacy loss, returning a noisy answer to researchers, who would have indicated their accuracy guarantee beforehand. "

Since the camera uses a laser to determine the distance of a subject by measuring how long the light takes to reflect back to the machine, the new software can tell the camera to ignore everything else that falls outside of that time signature. The camera uses a new algorithm to stitch together the data collected and form a recognizable image. "

Previously, directors had to send footage of human actors to render farms (groups of powerful computers) that would add graphical elements in a process that could take days to complete. The VR headset incorporates a stack of high-powered chips originally designed for gaming, which provide directors the opportunity to see immediately how a scene will look with the addition of computer-generated elements. The director can be immersed in the three-dimensional world of the scene and find the best camera angles. Independent filmmaker Kevin Margo said the technology can reduce the cost of visual effects up to 20% by trimming the expenses of lighting, and of the process to combine the elements into a single image.

Security researcher Vitali Kremez said RobbinHood appears to focus exclusively on files on a single system, apparently infecting individual computers through psexec and/or domain controller compromise. Kremez added that this suggests the attacker must have already secured administrative-level access to a system on the network, ""due to the way the ransomware interacts with C:\Windows\Temp directory."" RobbinHood also relies on having a public RSA key present on the targeted computer so it can encrypt files. Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young said Wednesday he was uncertain how long the city's systems would be offline. ""There is a backup system with the IT department,"" Young said, ""but we can't just go and restore because we don’t know how far back the virus goes.” "

The accelerator, which can be added to the CPU, runs on a small amount of chip area and power, and can handle garbage collection more efficiently by performing a larger number of memory operations concurrently. The device far outperformed a CPU core, and cut the amount of power needed for garbage collection by 15%. Maas said, ""This means that you could build a system where the software does not have to worry about garbage collection at all and just keeps using the available memory."" "

Python is considered a more general language than R, which was designed specifically for large datasets and statistical analysis. However, multiple language indexes have shown a decline in R's popularity, despite growth in machine learning. Python's growth and R's decline also could be attributed to the increase in high-quality Python libraries for statistics and machine learning, making it a more attractive starting point for new developers. Tiobe also speculates this trend could be linked to the fact that ""statistical programming is finding its way from university to industry nowadays and Python is more accepted by the industry."" "

Cellphones are a key cause of driver distraction, as are in-vehicle infotainment systems; despite the addition of voice activation to minimize manual interaction with the latter, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found such systems' cognitive and visual demands inconsistent, and in many cases forced drivers to focus on the task at hand rather than on driving. AAA's testing of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto products, which allow drivers to control cellphones via the infotainment system, determined they both distracted drivers less than built-in infotainment systems. However, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Bryan Reimer warned autonomous vehicle technology has the unintended effect of causing drivers to seek other forms of distraction. "

While piloting a single drone by remote control is relatively simple, operating a fleet requires an automated system to coordinate the task, allowing drones to independently respond to unexpected events. The new model considers the energy required for each drone to complete its portion of a task and fly to a charging station as needed. Based on the model, the researchers developed three offline optimization techniques and one online algorithm. The researchers conducted a series of simulations using four drones to test for efficiency and security, and found the online algorithm successfully managed the security-energy trade-off within the energy limits of the drone.

The researchers performed three experiments focused on Caudipteryx, which walked on two legs and had a pair of feathery ""proto-wings."" First, the team used fossil analyses to develop a simplified mathematical model of the dinosaur. They then simulated a running motion in the model's legs, and calculated how other parts of the body would respond. For the second test, the team created a robo-Caudipteryx and ran it on a treadmill; they observed consistent oscillation even as they increased and decreased wing length. Finally, the team built a harness with force sensors and a set of wings, and applied it to many different types of birds, before settling on a six-month-old ostrich. As the ostrich ran, flapping was evident, and sensors measured a small amount of lift. "

The team's neural network is based on vectors rotating in a multidimensional space, rather than on multiplication of matrices. The rotational unit of memory (RUM) system basically represents each word in the text by a vector in multidimensional space, with each subsequent word skewing this vector in some direction, represented by a theoretical space that can ultimately have thousands of dimensions. At the conclusion, the final vector or set of vectors is translated back into its corresponding string of words. Testing suggested RUM could be useful with natural language processing, so the researchers fed scientific papers through the network, generating a much more readable summary than a conventional neural network yielded.

The researchers' machine learning algorithm can analyze genetic tests, which detect patterns in tumors demonstrating whether they have a deficiency in homologous DNA repair. This deficiency makes those growths susceptible to treatment by medications called PARP inhibitors, like Astra's Lynparza or Glaxo's Zejus. Oncologists usually identify this susceptibility by testing for mutations that suppress cellular DNA repair, using a specific mechanism; however, many tumors lacking such flaws also may possess the same weakness, but are harder to detect in the absence of a specific gene test. The researchers said the new algorithm is applicable to genetic tests that are already performed on many tumors. "

These algorithms can be used to create a detailed map of an area in preparation for tree marking (prior to cutting), to closely monitor the development of individual trees, and to identify habitats most suited to certain animal species. Parkan calibrated the algorithms using a reference dataset of more than 5,000 trees taken from a three-dimensional point cloud. For this, he created a digital forestry toolbox to facilitate the manual extraction of trees and the visual identification of tree species. This allowed Parkan to verify the algorithms could reliably detect the location and shape of trees, and to calibrate the classification models for nine tree species. Said Parkan, ""My aim was to develop methods and tools that can supplement on-the-ground inventories, rather than replace them."" "

The researchers found that it would cost four times less to close down a few medium-sized airports first instead of the largest hubs. This method would be equally as effective in containing the spread of a virus. The researchers studied this scenario for Europe, North America, and Asia as parts of the worldwide air traffic network, and showed that the closure of medium-sized airports would affect only 6% of global air passengers, while closing the largest hubs would affect 25%. The researchers determined which airports to close using the ""dismantling problem,"" which determines the nodes that need to be deactivated or removed from a network in order to disrupt the malfunctioning of a system.

The system uses a neural network to predict if a specific element will appear frequently in a data stream. If it does, it is placed in a separate bucket of so-called ""heavy hitters"" to focus on; if it does not, it is handled via hashing. During testing, the researchers showed the learning-based approach had about 57% fewer errors in estimating the amount of Internet traffic on a network, and about 71% fewer errors in estimating the number of queries for a given search term. LearnedSketch could help technology companies more effectively analyze a range of meaningful data, from trending topics on Twitter to spikes in Web traffic that could suggest future distributed denial-of-service attacks. Said MIT researcher Chen-Yu Hsu, ""These kinds of results show that machine learning is very much an approach that could be used alongside the classic algorithmic paradigms like 'divide and conquer' and dynamic programming.""

This has raised issues about the regulation of pricing algorithms, which are currently used in various industries. The University of Bologna's Emilio Calvano cited several views of this issue, including one that regulation should be avoided because the market is ultimately self-correcting. Another school of thought urges the creation of a new regulator that tests algorithms in government computers before they are allowed in the marketplace. Calvino said he supports a third option, in which companies would be permitted to innovate and deploy such algorithms in marketplaces, ""because they can do a lot of good."" The government's antitrust authorities should then monitor them, Calvano said, and intercede if they are being used anti-competitively, which might require updating antitrust statutes. "

LightStore modifies sold-state drives (SSDs) to connect directly to a datacenter's network and to support computationally simpler and more efficient data storage operations. Additional software and hardware innovations seamlessly integrate the system into existing datacenter infrastructure. The researchers found a cluster of four storage nodes ran twice as efficiently as traditional storage servers, as measured by the power needed to field data requests. The cluster also required less than half the physical space occupied by existing servers. MIT’s Arvind described the system as “a simpler, cheaper storage solution … that’s going to take half as much space and half the power, yet provide the same throughput capacity performance. That will help you in operational expenditure, as it consumes less power, and capital expenditure, because energy savings in datacenters translate directly to money savings.” "

483,ACM,Warnings of a Dark Side to AI in Health Care,ACM,2019-03-21,-,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/science/health-medicine-artificial-intelligence.html,"Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers warn in a recently published study that new artificial intelligence (AI) technology designed to enhance healthcare is vulnerable to misuse, with ""adversarial attacks"" that can deceive the system into making misdiagnoses being one example. A more likely scenario is of doctors, hospitals, and other organizations manipulating the AI in billing or insurance software in an attempt to maximize revenue. The researchers said software developers and regulators must consider such possibilities as they build and evaluate AI technologies in the years to come. MIT's Samuel Finlayson said, ""The inherent ambiguity in medical information, coupled with often-competing financial incentives, allows for high-stakes decisions to swing on very subtle bits of information."" Changes doctors make to medical scans or other patient data in an effort to satisfy the AI used by insurance firms also could wind up in a patient's permanent record. "

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has delayed action for 15 months on General Motors' request to deploy a small number of vehicles on U.S. roads without human controls. GM wants the NHTSA to compare a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer to a vehicle piloted by a human driver. NHTSA is also seeking public comment on a separate petition by driverless delivery startup Nuro to deploy a limited number of low-speed highly automated delivery vehicles without human occupants. Both petitions seek exemptions from U.S. vehicle safety regulations written decades ago that assume human drivers would always be in control of a vehicle. The NHTSA will accept public comments on the proposals for at least 60 days.

The second law of thermodynamics posits that an isolated system can only remain static or evolve toward a state of chaos. The researchers used a four-stage process for their experiment. The first stage featured an ordered state, with each qubit grounded at zero. During the second stage, an evolution program was used to trigger the degradation of order, causing the qubits to begin assuming an increasingly complex pattern of zeros and ones. In the third stage, another program was used to ""reverse time,"" causing the qubits to evolve from chaos to order; that is, to reground themselves at zero. For stage four, the evolution program is relaunched from the second stage, causing the qubits to revert to their earlier state. When scientists used a two-qubit computer to conduct the experiment, they observed qubits moving from chaos to order every time; when they introduced a third qubit, the computer produced more errors.

For example, distinguishing between a yellow taxi and a pair of binoculars seems simple, but if an image of a taxi is flipped upside down, many AI systems see a pair of binoculars. The Auburn researchers took images of common objects from ImageNet and randomly rotated and changed the position of the objects in the pictures. The team found this minor change was enough to confuse several state-of-the-art image-recognition systems 97% of the time, averaged across all of the systems. The biggest hurdle to progress for this technology is that when an AI system looks at an image, it cannot extract rules about the object shown that would help it identify a similar object in the future.

Voters authenticate themselves to the voting website using their birthdate and an initialization code they receive from the Swiss national postal service. After voters make their selections on screen, the votes are encrypted and sent to Swiss Post servers, where they are processed through a ""mix network"" that cryptographically shuffles the votes to ensure they cannot be matched to the voter, before decrypting and counting them. The flaw is in the zero-knowledge proof, used to demonstrate that ballots have not been swapped out during shuffling.

While this is not a huge increase, it sets a record for the most bits per second squeezed through a limited fiber bandwidth. The new method, called 16QUAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), digitally modulates a four-bit code so it can have one of 16 values at every interval. This allowed the researchers to transmit a record 6.21 bits per second per hertz of bandwidth. This high-data-rate transmission pushed the cable close to the Shannon noise limit (the theoretical maximum information transfer rate of a channel for a particular noise level). In order to circumvent the Shannon limit, Facebook wants to increase the fiber count in cables, which will require redesigning cables so they can provide more electrical power for repeaters situated along their routes, and so the cables can fit more than 25 fiber pairs.

This breakthrough is similar to the natural learning that happens in babies, as the robotic limb was first allowed to understand its environment in a process of free play, known as ""motor babbling."" The random movements of the leg that take place during motor babbling allow the robot to build an internal map of its limb and its interactions with the environment. The robots use their unique experience to develop the gait pattern that works well enough for them, producing robots with personalized movements. Said USC researcher Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas, ""Because our robots can learn habits, they can learn your habits, and mimic your movement style for the tasks you need in everyday life—even as you learn a new task, or grow stronger or weaker.""

The robot can compensate for a broken limb or motor, as each leg is powered by three identical, swappable electric motors built from off-the-shelf parts. MIT's Benjamin Katz said the mini cheetah's modular design is advantageous compared to a larger predecessor, because adding or modifying the smaller robot does not require an across-the-board redesign.

576,ACM,IBM Doubles Quantum Performance,ACM,2019-03-04,-,https://www.cbronline.com/news/ibm-quantum-computing,"IBM said it has advanced quantum-computing performance while recording the lowest error rates it has ever quantified. The company measures performance through Quantum Volume, a full-system metric encompassing gate and measurement errors, device cross talk and connectivity, and circuit software compiler efficiency. The company says quantum performance has doubled every year since 2017. However, according to IBM, quantum computers are still too ‘noisy’ to allow meaningful computations, especially since quantum switches typically begin to fail after just fractions of a second (compared to the scale of years before classical switches typically fail).

In this way, malefactors could plant malware within the code, allowing them to eavesdrop on the server, change its data, or destroy it at will. The researchers said this method affects bare metal servers, in which a customer rents and fully controls an entire computer in an attempt to enhance performance or security. The Eclypsium team focused on the firmware of a powerful component in IBM's Super Micro servers, offered to users of its baseboard management controller (BMC). The BMC is employed to remotely monitor and administrate the server, and its capabilities include accessing memory and altering the operating system. "

The new technique works with accuracy similar to that of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), which beams subatomic particles through a specimen in order to image it. The new three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method is accurate, less operator-dependent, and less time-consuming than the TEM method. Traditional light microscopy examines only a few one- to two-micron-thick slices of a biopsy, with each slice just one or two microns thick, allowing for only a two-dimensional (2D) analysis. However, state-of-the-art 3D imaging software can examine about 50 slices and reconstruct them into a complete 3D image. Said University of Melbourne researcher Niloufar Torkamani, ""The whole traditional 2D side of medicine will be phased out very soon, because it just won’t be seen as practical anymore. It’s like playing a computer game in 2D, when you can be in 3D or even virtual reality."" "

In collaboration with researchers at the CEA-LETI institute in France, the Stanford team used resistive random access memory (RRAM) as a key element of the new chip. RRAM features storage density that can embed more data within less space than other forms of memory, while its energy efficiency does not strain limited power supplies; it also can retain data during chip hibernation. Engineers also can build RRAM directly atop a processing circuit to integrate data storage and computation within a single chip, and the CEA-LETI cohort grafted the RRAM onto a silicon processor. The Stanford team boosted RRAM storage capacity, and developed an algorithm to lengthen endurance, so the prototype should be capable of operating for a decade. "
641,ACM,Google Researchers Say Software Alone Can’t Mitigate Spectre Chip Flaws,ACM,2019-02-19,-,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/google-spectre-cpu-bug,"It will be difficult to avoid Spectre bugs in the future unless central processing units (CPUs) are dramatically overhauled, according to a team of Google researchers. In addition, they said processors that perform speculative execution always will remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks, despite mitigations that may be discovered in the future. The researchers found that in order to truly remedy all existing and future Spectre bugs, hardware manufacturers will need to develop new CPU microarchitecture designs. The team offered several potential solutions, including disabling speculative execution entirely, precision timer mitigation, and branchless matching. The researchers also noted these mitigations are not without their own issues, such as performance penalties. ""It is now a painful irony that today, defense requires even more complexity with software mitigations, most of which we know to be incomplete,"" the researchers concluded. "

The team tested and calibrated the model using valuations from a pool of test subjects, who were asked to assess 60 everyday products from a Swiss supermarket. For each product, each participant was asked how much they wanted to eat it at the end of the experiment. After the first rating phase, the process was immediately repeated to account for the variability of brain signals to produce such ratings. In the second experiment, the test subjects were presented with two products at the same time and were asked to choose one. In this case the computer, which had already been fed the data from the first experiment, was able to predict the participants' decisions with high accuracy. "

The systems can be engineered to alert police and instantly send texts and other alerts to employees. Once the sensors detect a gunshot, the devices can track the shooter as he moves through a building, via a camera connection; each new gunshot can be localized by another device in the network. According to Shooter Detection Systems CEO Christian Connors, the sensors can tell a gunshot from a car backfiring, firecracker exploding, or balloon popping, because they listen for a muzzle blast's specific signature.

The TLI is set up so the car communicates wirelessly with traffic lights outfitted with the technology; if the light is red, or going to be red when the car reaches the intersection, a traffic signal icon appears on the head-up display, dashboard display, or both, with a countdown informing the driver how long it will take to see a green light. The TLI also indicates the speed to maintain to avoid stopping at upcoming lights. The Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory uses traffic signal data and vehicle position to calculate speed recommendations allowing drivers to reach traffic signals while they are green. The upgraded signals transmit reports to the municipalities that operate them, and local governments send the information to Traffic Technology Services (TTS). TTS sends that data to Audi, which sends it to cars via 4G LTE cellular connections. "

The technique could help art conservationists and historians preserve imperiled artwork, and also reveal hidden secrets underneath the canvas. For example, conservationists originally thought small ""blebs"" in the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe were embedded grains of sand, but they were later identified as byproducts of chemical reactions between components of the paint. Northwestern's app could monitor the blebs' growth, and help conservationists determine ways to diagnose problems, prevent or retard damage, and perhaps restore the painting; the app-rendered images also could indicate the presence of older paintings beneath more-recent surface layers. A beta version of the app is being used by conservators at a number of museums, with a finalized version to be publicly issued later this year. "

The design was created to track flying foxes, also known as fruit bats, in Australia because they are important seed dispersers and because they serve as a vector for infectious diseases. More accurate tracking requires taking more frequent GPS samples, which means the device will consume more energy. The CSIRO researchers developed a system that involves three layers that collectively allow for more accurate localization on a device small enough to be fitted to a flying fox or other such animal. The device accounts for the general movement patterns of the species being studied, and the system learns to recognize these patterns. Said CSIRO researcher Philipp Sommer, ""Our evaluation results have shown that our approach can significantly increase positioning accuracy for a dynamic energy budget."" "

Nevertheless, a number of borders around the world are being modernized; for example, Switzerland hopes to digitize its border procedures with the European Union fully by 2026, using its DaziT program to establish a central online portal for all customs services. Blockchain technology will likely shield the security of such systems. Singapore and other ports are already using IBM/Maersk's blockchain-based TradeLens process to access electronic data for tracking shipping containers and their contents for importers, freight forwarders, port operators, and customs authorities. Even with electronic security measures, authorities will still require physical safeguards to prevent smuggling. At the Swedish-Norwegian border, for example, equipment like automatic license-plate recognition cameras is used to check passing vehicles. "

It is important to verify the correctness of regular expressions in software development, because it enforces consistency between the current development phase of a piece of software and its initial requirements. The IST tool makes this step less complicated and more efficient than existing verification methods. "
703,ACM,Computer Program Aims to Reduce DNA Contamination in Microbial Samples,ACM,2019-02-05,-,https://news.ncsu.edu/2019/02/decontam-callahan/,"North Carolina State University and Stanford University researchers have developed an open source software package that identifies contaminants in a sample, using statistical patterns of the frequency and presence of contaminants versus non-contaminants. Decontam is an algorithm that uses a simple binary classifier to distinguish between contaminants and non-contaminants on the basis of two patterns across samples: contaminants will increase in frequency as the amount of input DNA decreases, and contaminants will be present in a higher fraction of negative control samples. During testing, Decontam reduced the number of sequencing reads derived from contaminants by upwards of 99% in data collected from human mouths. The method was especially good at identifying and removing contaminants most likely to interfere with subsequent analyses. "

Computer Axial Lithography (CAL) carves an object out of synthetic resin that solidifies when it comes into contact with specific light patterns and intensities. CAL printing starts with a computer simulation of a 3D object, fed into a digital video projector that beams the image into a rotating cylinder containing the resin. Explains UC Berkeley's Hayden Taylor, ""As the container rotates, the pattern that's projected changes, so over time the amount of light that each point receives can be controlled. Spots that receive a lot of light solidify, while those that do not remain liquid.""

With assistance from lead developer Evgeny Medvedev, Google's senior developer advocate for Google Cloud Allen Day created a suite of sophisticated software to search the data. In the past year, more than 500 projects were created using these tools, collectively known as Blockchain ETL (extract, transform, load), designed to do everything from predicting the price of bitcoin to analyzing wealth disparity among ether holders. Day demonstrated Blockchain ETL by examining the so-called hard fork, or an irrevocable split in a blockchain database, which created a new cryptocurrency—bitcoin cash—from bitcoin in the summer of 2017. Using Google's BigQuery, Day discovered bitcoin cash, rather than increasing microtransactions, was actually being hoarded among big holders of bitcoin cash. "

733,ACM,Fleet of Robots to Park Cars at Gatwick Airport,ACM,2019-01-30,-,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1079917/gatwick-airport-robots-parking-stan-crawley-council,"Gatwick Airport in the U.K. is working with Stanley Robotics to test a fleet of robot valets to park cars for arriving travelers. The system could increase the amount of parking space available at the airport, because robotically parked cars do not need space for drivers to get in and out. Stanley Robotics previously rolled out the robots, called ""Stan,"" at Lyon Airport in France. When a Stan robot detects a vehicle, it slides under the vehicle, lifts it gently by the wheels, and moves it to a storage area. The robot also logs the traveler's itinerary details so the vehicle will be ready for pickup when they return. Gatwick Airport officials hope 8,500 robot-parked cars will fit into the current 6,000 self-park spots. "

The researchers utilized data from a 2016 ProPublica investigation into COMPAS automated recidivism assessment software, which exhibited bias against African-American defendants. The researchers devised unique strategies for assessing and processing risk scores to reduce false positives and false negatives, and yield greater fairness toward different groups of people. They initially configured the automated decision-maker and scoring classifier separately for different populations, then revised the decision-maker to declare some cases as uncertain, particularly when risk scores were close to decision thresholds. When applied to the COMPAS data, the method determined only 75% of the cases got a correct automated decision, and the others required deferment to a separate process. BU’s Adam Smith said, “Our goal is to give people a language and a set of mathematical tools for reasoning about these complicated, multi-staged systems in a way that is not possible right now because we don’t have the conceptual framework, we don’t have the terminology, and we don’t have the math.” "

740,ACM,Most People Overlook AI Despite Flawless Advice,ACM,2019-01-30,-,https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3360,"U.S. Army researchers and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara have found a persistent gap in basic knowledge about the use of artificial intelligence (AI), and it is unknown which AI aspects will or will not help military decision-making. The researchers developed an online game in which players obtained points by making good decisions in each round; an AI was used to generate advice in each round, which was shown alongside the game interface. The AI also made suggestions about which decisions players should make, which they were free to accept or ignore. About 66% of human decisions disagreed with the AI, regardless of the number of errors in the suggestions. The researchers concluded these findings present a catch-22 for system designers: incompetent users need AI the most, but are least likely to be swayed by their rational justifications. "

His mother, Michele, sent a video of the hack to Apple Support, warning the company of a ""major security flaw"" that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. She also emailed and faxed Apple's security team, and posted to Twitter and Facebook about the vulnerability; however, it was not until more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem that the company disabled Group FaceTime and started working on a fix. The bug, and Apple's slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company's commitment to security, despite the fact it regularly advertises its bug reward program and brags about the safety of its products. Said Patrick Wardle of Digita Security, “If these kinds of bugs are slipping through, you have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.” "
